These .craft files are as accurate as possible recreations of real and proposed designs. As BDB is updated, improvements will be implemented. They are set up so that they can be easily merged into the .craft file of the payload.

Most of those .craft files require both Conformal Decals and Simple Adjustable Fairings. They have accurately replicated paint schemes from real launch vehicles. Not every paint scheme had been replicated.

The following extras folders need to be installed:
3delta_propellant_densification
Pafftek
RealFlags
Titan_AJ9

BDB_RealNames are recommended, but not a dependency. 
Tested with FAR and Principia in KSRSS, results might not hold up 100% under stock conditions, but the rockets should still fly. Larger payloads can be expected in JNSQ, for example.
Read the PDF manual for more info on specific launch vehicles.
