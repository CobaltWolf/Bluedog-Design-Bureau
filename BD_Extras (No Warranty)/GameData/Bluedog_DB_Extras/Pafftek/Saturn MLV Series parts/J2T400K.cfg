	@title = Sarnus-HE2JT-400K "Tohces" Cryogenic Aerospike
	@description = A development of the Dnoces engine, the Tohces reuses a number of components such as turbopumps, while exchanging the bell-shaped thrust chamber for an annular aerospike. The result is a slightly lighter engine, with higher ISP. The 400K sub-variant, is able to perform gimbaling using a hydraulic thrust structure.

	%real_title = J-2T-400K Annular Aerospike
	%real_description =  The third experimental variant of the Annular Aerospike J-2T family, the -400K has 400,000 Pounds of thrust.  The higher thrust is achieved by utilizing a scaled down HG-3 power head instead of the J-2S power head.
