	@title = Sarnus-HE2JT-400K "Tohces" Cryogenic Aerospike
	@description = A development of the Dnoces engine, the Tohces reuses a number of components such as turbopumps, while exchanging the bell-shaped thrust chamber for an annular aerospike. The result is a slightly lighter engine, with higher ISP. The 400K sub-variant, is able to perform gimbaling using a hydraulic thrust structure.
