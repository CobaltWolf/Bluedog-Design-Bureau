	@title = Sarnus-HESL3GH-620-S "Super Dnoces Sea Level" Cryogenic Engine
	@description = The HESL3GH is a sea level derived "Super Dnoces" engine.  In short it works better down low but has high efficiencies none the less.
	%real_title = HG-3 Sea Level
	%real_description = With it's narrow bell, the HG-3SL is a Sea level rated version of the infamous HG-3 engine.  Staged combustion and improved J-2 dynamic parts mean this engine is more powerful for your MLV launches.
