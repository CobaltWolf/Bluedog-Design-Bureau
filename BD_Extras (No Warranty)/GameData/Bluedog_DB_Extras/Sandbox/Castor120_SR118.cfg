	@description = One of the largest monolithic solid motors ever created, the 1.5m diameter "Tyndareus" implements advanced construction techniques shared with out CGR booster family. The nozzle is optimized for sea level flight, though this motor is sometimes used as a second stage. Originally as the first stage of a very peaceful nuclear deterrent, surplus boosters have been purchased and refurbished by BDB and sold to you, our valued customer, at a discount. Some extra charges may apply.
