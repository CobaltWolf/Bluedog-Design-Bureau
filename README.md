Stockalike parts pack for Kerbal Space Program

What is this mod?

Variety is the spice of life. BDB doesn't necessarily add new gameplay hooks, new systems to the game, new features. What it does add, are parts. Lots of parts. The mod adds a tremendous number of parts, including launchers, spacecraft parts, and probe parts, all in a stockalike style. The focus lies primarily on the US space program, mostly before Apollo but including several other parts. The parts are not perfect replicas, but rather take inspiration directly from existing designs. Care has been taken to research and include parts for projects that were proposed but never happened, to increase the possibilities available to the player. Parts are made in a lego frame of mind, and I greatly encourage you to mix and match parts to see what cool things you come up with. The mod is not recommended for new players, as the mod adds a good deal of clutter to the VAB lists. The mod also adds new standard sizes (such a 0.9375m, 1.5m and 1.875m diameter) of parts in order to more accurately scale to KSP.
Extreme care has been taken to leave the mod with as small a footprint as possible while keeping the graphical fidelity to acceptable levels. The textures are not HD, however they are intended to look as good if not better than stock textures. For example, the entire Titan rocket series (39 parts total) is made using 1x 1024 texture sheet and five 512 texture sheets (1 per fuel tank series, 1 for SRBs and 1 for Transtage). Compared to stock, which generally uses a 1024 texture for a single part, the savings are enormous. I have also held off from making normal maps for parts in order to keep the RAM impact as low as possible.
For those familiar with KSP mods, BDB can be considered a stockalike equivalent of FASA, and a US counterpart to Tantares' soviet rockets.

Currently, the mod includes (but is not limited to) parts to make:
- Mercury and Gemini capsules
- Vanguard rocket with Able and Ablestar upper stages
- Redstone rocket
- Juno II, IV rockets
- Diamant rocket
- Thor-Delta rocket
- Delta 2 rocket
- Atlas rocket (Atlas A thru Atlas IIAS. Atlas III is not included at present)
- Agena upper stage
- Centaur upper stage
- Atlas V rocket
- Titan I, II, III, IV rockets, with SRMs and Transtage
- Saturn 1 with S-IV stage
- New probe cores
- New antennas and dishes
- New science experiments

Planned content includes massive Saturn rockets including unflown variants, launchers based on Atlas and Titan that never left the drawing board, and parts based on proposed projects for Gemini and Apollo.
