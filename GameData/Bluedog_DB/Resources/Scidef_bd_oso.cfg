	RESULTS
	{
	default = Data from a variety of solar sensors is recorded to be sent back to Kerbin.
	default = Readings confirm that Kerbol is, indeed, hot.

		KerbinInSpaceLow = Wow, it looks the experiment is safe from solar radiation!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = It seems that the more you go away from Kerbin, the less protected you are from Kerbol.

		MunInSpaceLow = We discovered something called "Solar wind", proving that not all winds are made by Gene Kerman. (In the back of Mission Control, you hear Gene saying "I told you so!")
		MunInSpaceHigh = Apparently, a full Mun isn't caused by the Mun itself, but by Kerbol light bouncing off the Munar dust.

		MinmusInSpaceLow = It's confirmed. The heat of Kerbol doesnt make Minmus melt.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = We found that without an atmosphere, there is no way to get electrocuted. The people back in the VAB will be pleased with that one!

		MohoInSpaceLow = A beautiful light is seen dancing around the planet's poles. It is mesmerizing.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho's weak magnetic field provides little protection from the fierce solar wind.

		EveInSpaceLow = Eve's thick atmosphere is sucking up the heat of Kerbol like a sponge.
		EveInSpaceHigh = Eve's thick atmosphere reflects light like a big purply mirror. It would look great in your bathroom.

		GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly's rocky texture makes the detector think we're on the beach! Mission Control confirms: The detector isn't laying on the beach.
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly is so small, Kerbol doesn't notice it. Votes go up to buy Kerbol some glasses.

		DunaInSpaceLow = The larger distance between Duna to Kerbol makes it feel colder than Kerbin
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Kerbol heating up Duna dust can cause massive dust storms. Better be careful here...

		IkeInSpaceLow = The dark spots on Ike are caused by shadows and soil coloration. Not by Kerbol immunity.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Ike seems to be immune to Kerbol rays, being very dark in some places

		DresInSpaceLow = Solar winds are causing a stable electric cocoon to form in the craters of Dres. This could be useful in the future.
		DresInSpaceHigh = Kerbol's rays seem to be bouncing on and off Dres. Further researching is required confirming Dres isn't made of rubber

		JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's magnetic field seems to be working like a massive dynamo, reacting in ways we could have never guessed
		JoolInSpaceHigh = The huge strength of Jool's magnetic field is causing the systems to go hay-wire

		LaytheInSpaceLow = Temperatures are cold, even though we're enjoying Kerbol heating us up. Interesting.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = Mission Control is confused if they're looking at the Kerbin data, or if this is new data from another planet

		VallInSpaceLow = The Kerbol rays are having a frequency shift this close to Vall!
		VallInSpaceHigh = The heating of Vall's surface by Kerbol causes cracks in the surface where fluid comes out. At Mission Control, the idea for a space waterpark gets tossed around.

		TyloInSpaceLow = Heating of the surface by Kerbol has caused large differences in color. A bit like a burnt egg.
		TyloInSpaceHigh = The sensors say that "convection" is taking place. Mission Control doesn't really know what to do about that.

		BopInSpaceLow = Kerbol is charging our batteries over here as well!
		BopInSpaceHigh = The surface of Bop is reacting with the rays of Kerbol!

		PolInSpaceLow =  Kerbol seems to have no influence on the surface of Pol, making the surface a result of purely volcanic activity
		PolInSpaceHigh = The spikeyness of Pol's surface is scaring the sensor

		EelooInSpaceLow = Kerbol is causing Eeloo's ice to melt. Some at KSC are suggesting a massive freezer to keep it safe.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = This far out of the Kerbol system, the influence of Kerbol is very faint.

		AsteroidInSpaceLow = The dark side of the asteroid is freezing cold. We should've brought a heater.
		AsteroidInSpaceHigh = The side of the asteroid facing Kerbol is incredibly hot, being bombarded by Kerbol rays for millenia
		AsteroidSrfLanded = The detector is transmitting that it is "just chillin'". Mission Control is trying to decipher this message.
