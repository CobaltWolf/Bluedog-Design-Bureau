	RESULTS
	{
	default = A complete radio surveillance sweep of this planet is completed.
	KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = Significant levels of radio chatter are picked up on Kerbin, a surprising amount of which seems to be focused on spacecraft communications.
	KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = Some strange, intermittent radio transmissions are detected from near Kerbin's south pole.
	MunInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = A number of short, repeating radio wave transmissions are detected coming from numerous locations on the Mun's surface.
	MunInSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = Radio reconnaissance sweeps of the Mun's southern hemisphere record a long, repeating message coming from a very specific location on the surface.
	MinmusInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = A singe radio chirp is being broadcast from somewhere just above the surface on Minmus.
	MinmusInSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = Only faint background radio chatter from Kerbin is picked up in scans of Minmus.
	SunInSpaceLow = The sun emits a constant stream of radio emissions over a broad spectrum, with occasional spikes due to localized increases in solar activity.
	MohoInSpaceLow = Radio emissions from the sun swamp out any trace of transmissions coming from Moho.
	EveInSpaceLow = Strong interactions between the solar wind and Eve's thick atmosphere are likely to be responsible for the constant blast of radio wave activity in this area.
	GillyInSpaceLow = Radio surveillance of the tiny moon Gilly is met with indifferent silence.
	DunaInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = Some faint radio emission patterns are observed after repeated scans of Duna.
	DunaInSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = A fascinatingly complex radio transmission is recorded being broadcast from Duna's southern polar region.
	IkeInSpaceLow = Radio reconnaissance of Ike reveals little of interest, just a big dead rock.
	DresInSpaceLow = Complete radio silence…
	JoolInSpaceLow = A symphony of radio emissions are detected in low Jool space, arising both from interactions with the solar wind and through internal mechanisms.
	LaytheInSpaceLow = Laythe's atmosphere produces some interesting radio wave emissions.
	VallInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = Radio surveillance of Vall's northern hemisphere reveals nothing of interest.
	VallInSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = An amazingly consistent radio wave transmission is detected in the southern polar region of Vall.
	TyloInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = A very feint, but interesting radio transmission is detected somewhere in Tylo's northern hemisphere.
	TyloInSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = Nothing much of interest is detected after radio surveillance of Tylo, just a big scary rock.
	BopInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = Something very strange happened during radio surveillance of Bop, a tremendously powerful transmission was detected, then abruptly lost. Now nothing at all registers on the sensors.
	BopInSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = The tiny lifeless moon Bop has little of interest to offer.
	PolInSpaceLow = This tiny, colorful moon offers nothing of interest for radio reconnaissance.
	EelooInSpaceLow = Reconnaissance of lonely Eeloo reveals no signals of interest.
	SarnusInSpaceLow = Electrical activity in the atmosphere of Sarnus produces a cacophony of radio wave emissions.
	HaleInSpaceLow = Radio sweeps of Hale reveal no secrets from the tiny moon.
	OvokInSpaceLow = Some persistent radio wave activity is received during reconnaissance sweeps of Ovok; most likely caused by an interaction with Sarnus' magnetic field.
	SlateInSpaceLow = The seemingly barren moon Slate produces no interesting radio wave emissions.
	TektoInSpaceLow = Interactions between Tekto's atmosphere and the surrounding magnetic field produce isolated signals during radio surveillance sweeps.
	UrlumInSpaceLow = Radio surveillance of the ice giant Urlum reveals some interesting repeated patterns emitted from deep within the planet's atmosphere.
	PoltaInSpaceLow = Faint radio wave emissions are detected during radio reconnaissance of Polta.
	PriaxInSpaceLow = No radio signals are detected on Priax, most likely a captured asteroid.
	WalInSpaceLow = Seemingly random, faint radio wave patterns are detected during reconnaissance of Wal.
	TalInSpaceLow = The tiny sub-moon Tal produces some faint radio wave emissions which are easily picked up by the large dish.
	NeidonInSpaceLow = The ice giant Neidon produces strong, chaotic radio wave emissions.
	ThatmoInSpaceLow = Thatmo's thin atmosphere seems to interact with Neidon's magnetic field to generate some strange radio wave signals.
	NisseeInSpaceLow = The radio-dead moon Nissee is likely to be a large captured asteroid.
	PlockInSpaceLow = Only the faint background radio waves from the sun are detected in scans of Plock.
	KarenInSpaceLow = Surprisingly intense radio wave emissions are detected during surveillance of Karen, almost as a giant antenna was buried beneath the surface…
	MercuryInSpaceLow = Radio emissions from the sun swamp out any traces of transmissions coming from Mercury.
	VenusInSpaceLow = Strong interactions between the solar wind and Venus' thick atmosphere are likely to be responsible for the constant blast of radio wave activity in this area.
	MoonInSpaceLow = Faint, repetitive radio pings are detected on the surface of the Moon.
	MarsInSpaceLow = Weak radio signals are detected from a number of disparate locations on the surface of Mars.
	DeimosInSpaceLow = No radio signals are detected on Deimos, most likely a captured asteroid.
	PhobosInSpaceLow = Radio reconnaissance of Phobos reveals little of interest, just a big dead rock.
	JupiterInSpaceLow = A symphony of radio emissions are detected in low Jupiter space, arising both from interactions with the solar wind and through internal mechanisms.

	EuropaInSpaceLowNorthernHemisphere = Radio surveillance of Europa's northern hemisphere reveals nothing of interest.
	EuropaInSpaceLowSouthernHemisphere = A curious, simple radio wave transmission is detected from Europa's southern hemisphere; probably nothing more than instrument noise…
