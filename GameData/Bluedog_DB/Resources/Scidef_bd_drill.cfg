	RESULTS
	{
		default = The drill bores down into the ground, and a core sample is extracted.
		default = A core sample of bedrock is extracted from beneath the loose regolith on the surface. 

		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The dirt is a little too soft and loose to get a core sample from.
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = The dirt is a little too soft and loose to get a core sample from.
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = You wonder why you don't just pick up the rock you're drilling into and take the whole thing back.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The drill doesn't really work on sand! The drill's engineers will be shocked at this revelation.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Steam comes out of the bore hole as the drill heats up the frozen soil.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = A clear stick of ice is extracted from the drill. You wonder if it's lemonade flavoured...
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = The muddy core sample falls apart as you extract it.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The sample seems pretty bad.
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = How did you manage this?
		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Mission Control ask you to please stop making more holes in the launchpad.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Mission Control ask you to please stop making more holes in the Runway.

		// MunSrfLandedSouthWestCrater = #autoLOC_501378 //#autoLOC_501378 = There appear to be layers of completely different materials here.  It's possible this site has had multiple impacts.

		// PolSrfLanded = #autoLOC_501423 //#autoLOC_501423 = The sample is the same odd mottle of colors as the planet from orbit. You check off a little box on your list.
		// PolSrfLanded = #autoLOC_501424 //#autoLOC_501424 = After conducting samples of the surface, you determine with a high certainty that Pol is not, in fact, made of Pollen. This will cause quite the stir back home!

		MoonSrfLanded = A core sample of Lunar bedrock is extracted from beneath the loose regolith on the surface. 
		// MoonSrfLandedLowlands = Several heavy metal compounds are discovered in x-ray analysis of this sample, a number of which are radioactive.
		// MoonSrfLandedHighlands = Analysis reveals that the bright Lunar highlands are made up of aluminum- and calcium-rich feldspar crystals, mostly with very little iron and titanium content.
		// MoonSrfLandedMidlands = This sample contains a variety of glassy breccia minerals, formed when the violent impact of an asteroid fuses multiple minerals together.
		// MoonSrfLandedLunarSeas = The Lunar surface in these low-elevation regions shows signs of ancient volcanic activity along with much higher concentrations of olivine and pyroxene, normally expected to be found only deep in the mantle layer.
		// MoonSrfLandedMajorCraters = The minerals in this crater show signs of the rapid melting associated with an asteroid or comet impact.
		// MoonSrfLandedFarSideBasin = A number of iridium compounds are detected in x-ray analysis of samples from this basin, most of which was likely deposited here by an asteroid impact.
		// MoonSrfLandedNorthPole = Traces of nearly pure water ice are detected in analysis of this sample. This area is sheltered from the sun most of the time, allowing the water ice to persist.
		// MoonSrfLandedSouthPole = A number of hydrated silicates are discovered in this sample, a sure sign that relatively large amounts of water exist on the Lunar surface.
		// MarsSrfLanded = X-ray analysis of the surface reveals the presence of various so-called secondary, or alteration minerals, those formed in the presence of water, suggesting that this may have been part of an ancient lake bed.
		// MarsSrfLandedMidlands = Initial analysis of Mars' surface reveals mostly basaltic rock along with several hydrated silicates, sulfates and a coating of iron oxide, giving the surface its rusty coloration.
		// MarsSrfLandedHighlands = A number of interesting trace minerals are detected in x-ray analysis of this sample, including hematite and goethite, iron oxide minerals known to form in the presence of water.
		// MarsSrfLandedOlympusMons = A thick coating of basaltic lava is found in during analysis of the volcano.
		// MarsSrfLandedVallesMarineris = Analysis of this sample reveals relatively few hydrated minerals, it is composed primarily of basaltic rock; this is possibly an indication that this deep fissure was formed by an ancient rift valley, a sign of a more geologically active past for Mars.
		// MarsSrfLandedAreanMountains = Mars' mountainous areas are rich in basaltic minerals, a possible sign of volcanic origin.
		// MarsSrfLandedAreanCanyons = Very high concentrations of hydrated sulfur-rich minerals, primarily gypsum and kieserite, are found in analysis of this canyon area, an indication of an ancient body of surface water.
		// MarsSrfLandedNorthIceCap = Mars' North Pole consists mostly of pure water ice with a layer of frozen carbon dioxide on top
		// MarsSrfLandedSouthIceCap = The southern polar region of Mars is covered by a thick layer of water ice and carbon dioxide ice, obscuring any analysis of the soil below.
