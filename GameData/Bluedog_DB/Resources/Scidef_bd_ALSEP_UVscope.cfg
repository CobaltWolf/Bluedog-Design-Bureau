	RESULTS
	{
		default = You photograph several astronomical targets, capturing hot luminous stars in young star clusters, gaseous remnants of supernovae, and strange ghostly features on the planets.

		KerbinSrfLanded = This telescope is designed for use in space, but you figure you can probably substitute the film from a disposable camera to get some visible light pictures of the landscape. You figured wrong. You resolve to take a spotting scope, or a long-focus camera lens, or perhaps a decent pair of binoculars, next time you're out this way.
		MunSrfLanded = The Far-UV Camera is pointed towards Kerbin using the built-in digital setting circles and a small finderscope. The photograph reveals a luminous Kerbincorona of light from the outer atmosphere of Kerbin. Strange--up until now it was thought Kerbin's atmosphere ended at precisely 70 kilometers, but this Kerbincorona extends up to 15 Kerbin radii, or 9,000 kilometers. Airglow from solar radiation illuminates the sun-facing half of Kerbin's disk, and the auroral zones are visible as well as two equatorial airglow belts. The Camera is pointed at several astronomical targets as well, and it is able to observe star-forming regions in nearby galaxies much better than visible-light photography.
		MinmusSrfLanded = From its vantage point on Minmus' surface, the Far-UV Camera is pointed at Kerbin and Mun to study the interaction between the Kerbincorona, the magnetic tail, and the Mun. A faint glow is detected on the Mun in the long exposure. The Sun's corona and stellar wind has also been detected and probed, showing strong "helium" emission lines. The folks in the lab tell us they've never heard of helium before, so it may be a totally new element only found in space. Very preliminary, but exiciting stuff.
		MohoSrfLanded = With a special filter applied, the Far-UV camera is capable of taking detailed, high-resolution far-UV photographs of the Solar disk, with noisy bubbly plages and even some filaments and prominences detected. When pointed away from the Sun, the camera resolves the sodium-rich spectrum of Moho's comet-like tail.
		GillySrfLanded = The Far UV Camera takes images of Eve, revealing a bright corona of ionized particles escaping Eve via the Kerbolar Winds. Just about everything about Eve is incredibly violet, so it's no surprise that there's interesting phenomena to be found in the ultra-violet!
		EveSrfLanded = Just because this is an incredibly violet planet doesn't mean the ultraviolet camera will work here! Yeah. Whoop-dee-doo, we now know that Far-UV radiation does not penetrate Eve's atmosphere, but come on, you could have sent, like, a photometer here instead of an expensive gold-plated astrograph! There's so many better places to put this instrument! Like, you could put it on some kind of solar telescope mount on a space station, or you could send it to Eve's moon and look back.
		DunaSrfLanded = Dust in Duna's atmosphere prevents a substantial portion of far-UV radiation from reaching the instrument, however with long exposures, a faint glow is visible from Ike, especially when it is 'full,' curiously indicating some interaction with Duna's corona.
		IkeSrfLanded = The instrument is aimed at several distant astronomical targets, but most pressing of all is the view of Duna. There is a corona of ionizing upper-atmospheric particles being blown away by the solar wind, which is so large it threatens to fill the field of view of the camera. In fact it seems that the upper atmosphere of Duna may be interacting with Ike directly at certain times.
		DresSrfLanded = With no other nearby astronomical bodies to target, the Far-UV Camera is aimed exclusively at distant astronomical bodies to build up an all-sky view. The data gathered from this distant vantage point will be crucial in mapping out galactic star-forming regions, spectral classifications of hot young stars, and OH MY GOODNESS what is this faint dusty arch in the sky scattering light? There appears to be some kind of debris disk around Dres!
		LaytheSrfLanded = Ultraviolet radiation does not penetrate Laythe's atmosphere, but the good news is the damp condensation makes the golden case look extra shiny!
		JoolSrfLanded = Fun fact: Ultraviolet radiation can not penetrate green clouds.
		VallSrfLanded = The Far-UV Camera is pointed towards the satellites in the Jool system. Laythe has a complex glowing corona making up its exosphere, which smoothly blends into an incredibly luminous gas torus surrounding Laythe's orbit. Strangely, despite an apparent lack of atmosphere, Tylo has quite a bright corona as well, as though it has an exosphere similar to Laythe's and Kerbin's. Jool's atmosphere glows vibrantly with a dramatic and rapidly changing auroral pattern.
		TyloSrfLanded = The Far-UV Camera is pointed towards the satellites in the Jool system. Laythe has a complex glowing corona making up its exosphere, which smoothly blends into an incredibly luminous gas torus surrounding Laythe's orbit. Vall is associated with a significantly fainter gas torus with a few noticeable 'hot-spots' which may correspond to the low-lying regions in its crust. Jool's atmosphere glows vibrantly with a dramatic and rapidly changing auroral pattern.
		BopSrfLanded = The Far-UV Camera is pointed towards the satellites in the Jool system. Laythe has a complex glowing corona making up its exosphere, which smoothly blends into an incredibly luminous gas torus surrounding Laythe's orbit. Vall is associated with a significantly fainter gas torus with a few noticeable 'hot-spots' which may correspond to the low-lying regions in its crust. Tylo has quite a bright corona as well, as though it has an exosphere similar to Laythe's and Kerbin's. Jool's atmosphere glows vibrantly with a dramatic and rapidly changing auroral pattern.
		PolSrfLanded = The Far-UV Camera is pointed towards the satellites in the Jool system. Laythe has a complex glowing corona making up its exosphere, which smoothly blends into an incredibly luminous gas torus surrounding Laythe's orbit. Vall is associated with a significantly fainter gas torus with a few noticeable 'hot-spots' which may correspond to the low-lying regions in its crust. Tylo has quite a bright corona as well, as though it has an exosphere similar to Laythe's and Kerbin's. Jool's atmosphere glows vibrantly with a dramatic and rapidly changing auroral pattern. From such a distant orbit, the Joolcorona is faintly seen as a complex network of stellar wind flows, arching magnetic fields, and interaction with the gas toruses. The spectrum from Bop looks all wrong, but you can't quite put your finger on why.
		EelooSrfLanded = Far away from the Sun and with a special coronagraph filter, the camera is set up to take ultra-long-exposure images of the entire Kerbol System's solar winds. Interactions between the magnetic fields of the planets are mapped in subtle patterns of light and dark. The star-forming regions of the Milky Way stand as a bright, splotchy backdrop, and it will require quite some effort to untangle the starry background from the fainter coronal outflow. But out here... you have the time.
