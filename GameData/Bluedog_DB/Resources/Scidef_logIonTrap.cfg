	RESULTS
	{
	default = You measure the charged particles that pass through the trap.
	KerbinInSpaceLow = The amount of particles flowing through the trap is less than predicted... perhaps something is blocking them?
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = Now that Kerbin's magnetosphere isn't so in the way, we can collect particles far easier.
	MohoInSpaceLow = The heat radiating from Moho thrashes the ions back and forth, exciting them even more.
	MohoInSpaceHigh = The ions seem quite excited for being next to a flaming hot ball of gas and plasma.
	EveInSpaceHigh = Eve appears to have no significant effect on happy ions that pass into the trap.
	EveInSpaceLow = Eve's magnetosphere is smaller than Kerbin's. Data shows that her atmosphere is ripped off, however replenished by ferocious volcanic activity.
	GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly appears to have no effect on ions and charged particles passing into the trap.
	GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly must've never had a magnetosphere. Perhaps it's too small?
	MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun shows light traces of a magnetosphere.
	MunInSpaceLow = The Mun does definitely have a magnetosphere.
	MinmusInSpaceHigh = The data from the ion trap is inconclusive. It's unknown whether Minmus ever had a magnetosphere.
	MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus shows promising data. Minmus must have once had a thin magnetosphere during the creation of the solar system.
	DunaInSpaceHigh = Solar wind passes through the trap. The ions seem excited to be near such a red body.
	DunaInSpaceLow = Solar plasma passes through the trap. Due to the miniscule magnetosphere, Duna's atmosphere is being mangled by the solar wind of Kerbol.
	IkeInSpaceHigh = The ions around Ike are influenced by Duna's atmosphere being blown away by solar winds.
	IkeInSpaceLow = The ions around Ike are influenced by Duna's atmosphere being blown away by solar winds.
	DresInSpaceHigh = The data shows a slight increase in electromagnetic readings.
	DresInSpaceLow = Dres does, in fact, have a significant magnetosphere
	JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool's magnetosphere is strong all the way out here. Readings show that Jool's magnetosphere must reach past the orbit of Eeloo, concluding that this is, in fact, the largest planetary magnetosphere in the solar system...
	JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's magnetosphere is stronger than anywhere else, yet! The high radioactivity is scrambling your good readings!
	LaytheInSpaceHigh = The readings show a slight magnetosphere..
	LaytheInSpaceLow = The resemblance Laythe's magnetosphere shows compared to Kerbin makes you wonder about many things...
	VallInSpaceHigh = These readings show no promising results...
	VallInSpaceLow = You can now conclude that Vall may have never had a magnetosphere...
	TyloInSpaceHigh = Ion trap readings show good evidence of a strong magnetosphere around Tylo.
	TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo does indeed have a strong and tough magnetosphere according to the results.
	BopInSpaceHigh = These readings show no promising results...
	BopInSpaceLow = You can conclude that Bop never had a magnetosphere. This is just more evidence to stack onto the "Bop is a captured asteroid" argument.
	PolInSpaceHigh = These readings show no promising results...
	PolInSpaceLow = The pollen grain which you call Pol seems to be just like her sister. No magnetosphere...
	EelooInSpaceHigh = Little of the solar wind reaches this far out in the system. These readings aren't very promising...
	EelooInSpaceLow = Readings show that Eeloo might have a trace magnetosphere.
