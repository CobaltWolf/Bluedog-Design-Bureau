	JoolInSpaceLow = The inside of the planet's magnetosphere registers much different wave patterns than those from outside
	JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool's magnetic field creates unique radio wave disruptions that should hint at its internal composition

		BopInSpace = A signal faintly resembling Morse code is detected but follows no discernible electronic or natural pattern
		BopInSpace = Radio signals detected look to be a heavily degraded bounce of the spacecraft's own signal; likely deflected by the bow shock of the planet's magnetic field

	SarnusInSpace = Sarnus is found to have a very complex range of incredibly powerful radio emissions
	SarnusInSpace = Measurements of the rotation rate of the planet's plasma give good indication of the speed at which the magnetic lines rotate; as the plasma is directly affected by the magnetic field

		SlateInSpaceHigh = The instrument records some background noise from the planet
		SlateInSpace = Some detected noise is found to be an emission of plasma either deflected or generated by Sarnus
		SlateInSpaceLow = There is very little recorded interaction from the moon below. Likely due to the a lack of both atmosphere or active magnetism

		HaleInSpace = The instrument records some background noise from the planet
