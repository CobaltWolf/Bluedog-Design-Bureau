	RESULTS
	{
		default = The collided grains seem to be rather small.
		InSpace= The dust forms to a pancake-shaped cloud. This could cause a counterglow.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchpad = The entering grains consists of burnt rocket fuel particles.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The dust seems consists of pollution particles.
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = There is evidence that the dust consists of pollen, Kerbal hairs and spacesuit fibers.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = The density of the grains seems to be the same of pollen. Achoo..
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Lots of collisions, quite a dusty place.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = The same dust you can find on our bookshelves.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = A loose granular material. Probably the same you can find blanketing the beaches, riverbeds and deserts of Kerbin.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = Dust with a complex spectral signature incoming.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = We found evidence of extremely fine particles of mineral dust.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = A different dust up here. It seems to form a shape.
		//KerbinFlyingLowWater =
		//KerbinFlyingLowTundra =

		MunInSpaceHigh = This dust is not like talcum powder. It is kind of evil. It follows electric field lines, it works its way in equipment.
		MunInSpaceLow = High Densities! Good impact rate. Dust on low altitude should be able to cast a glow on sunset.
		MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = After every grain collision follows a collision with the same charge.
		MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = Lower collision rate, but heavy impacts.
		MunInSpaceLowMidlandCraters = Lower collision rate and weak impacts.
		MunInSpaceLowMidlands = Collision rate and impacts on an mean level.
		MunInSpaceLowHighlands = The grains have a high charge.
		MunInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = No grains are entering the sensor. Perhaps it is too cold.
		MunInSpaceLowFarsideCrater = Almost no collision, weak impacts.
		MunSrfLanded = Truth! The munar exosphere contains dust due to electrostatic levitation.

		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Almost no impacts. Density is lower than the density of water. But higher than the density of our cafeteria mint ice.
		MinmusInSpaceLowHighlands = We did find sulfate coatings on the ionized dust particles.
		MinmusInSpaceLowMidlands = The can of our instrument looks like a mint sundae.
		MinmusInSpaceLowLowlands = These results suggest that the particles being deposited have different composition to those still at higher altitudes.
		MinmusInSpaceLowSlopes = Low level dust.
		MinmusInSpaceLowGreatFlats = Notably no sulphate particles are present in the dust sampled. Indicating a lack of anthropogenic pollution.
		MinmusInSpaceLowGreaterFlats = Traces of dust from gypsum, quartz, NaCl (which may be sea salt or mineral halite), calcium rich particles, and calcium carbonates.
		MinmusInSpaceLowLesserFlats = Moderate dust storm.
		MinmusInSpaceLowFlats = Composition of particles with diameter greater than 1my.
		MinmusInSpaceLowPoles = Finding a lack of coatings on the ionized dust particles.

		GillyInSpaceLow = Dust with silicate cores colliding in the back of the instrument.
		GillySrfLanded = These grains have a sooty mantle consisting of amorphous carbon.

		MohoInSpaceLow = Density is almost as high as the density of flying ash.
		MohoSrfLanded = Fine powder made up of glassy spheres from sub-micron to more than 100 microns in size. Specific gravity 1.9 to 2.4 and a bulk density of 0.8-1 ton per cubic meter.

		EveInSpaceLow = The dust is glass like. Strong impacts incoming.
		EveFlying = The heavy impacts and the high collision rate are quite a stress test.

		DunaInSpaceLow = Incoming Grains vary in size between a few tenths of a nanometer to a few microns.
		DunaSrfLanded = The dust is quite grainy and shows sand like collisions.

		IkeInSpaceLow = Dust particles are few and far between.
		IkeSrfLanded = Only a few dust particles are entering the sensor. We should have brought a shovel.

		DresInSpaceLow = The dust seems to be composed of carbonaceous, silicate, and metallic grains.
		DresSrfLanded = The dust is so dense that it absorbs and scatters sun light.

		JoolInSpaceLow = No dust or the grains are too small to be recognized by the instrument.

		LaytheInSpaceLow = The dust tries to from a shape. We observed the same behavior near Kerbin.
		LaytheSrfLanded = A loose granular material. Probably it consists of calcium carbonate.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = No grains are entering the sensor.

		VallInSpaceLow = Dust tries to form a shape. Lower density than water.
		VallSrfLanded = The cold seems to trap the dust particles on the surface.

		TyloInSpaceLow = Avoid this one, it is just a lot of dust and drag and means nothing in the end.
		TyloSrfLanded = Due to the high gravity the dust clumps together to spheres.

		BopInSpaceLow = The dust is clustering to dense cores.
		BopSrfLanded = Too much dust in the sensor.

		PolInSpaceLow = Dusting this one would be a good start.
		PolSrfLanded = Weak impacts. Probably phosphoric or sulfuric origin.

		EelooInSpaceLow = Dust particles are few and far between.
		EelooSrfLanded = The Dust consists of CO, silicon carbide, amorphous silicate and lots of ice.

			HaleInSpace = Incoming Grains vary in size between a few tenths of a nanometer to a few microns

			HaleLanded = The detected grains are certainly material from the rings given their proximity
			
			OvokInSpace = Dust tries to form a shape. Lower density than water
			OvokLanded = Dust appears to be a very fine and fluffy material. It could just be snow...
