	RESULTS
	{
	default = You measure the amount of moisture in the planet's atmosphere.

	KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = Readings reveal high volumes of ethanol in the air.  Perhaps the administrators should cut back on lunch visits to the bar...
	KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The High-G centrifuge is located in this building and readings show significant levels of gastric acids nearby.
	KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The toxicity levels from evaporating rocket fuel shows up in analysis of the data from here.
	KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = The flag pole has some dew on it...WHAT AN AMAZING DISCOVERY!!!
	KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Toxicity levels from evaporating fuel has increased by an order of magnitude compared to the crawlerway.  Are you wearing a biohazard suit?
	KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = You really shouldn't be detecting any alcohol in the air near this facility but...
	KerbinSrfLandedR&D = The amount of hot air emanating from the mouths of the researchers here has evaporated most of the moisture in the area.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = You know, all you did was go around the corner.  The moisture readings have not changed.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = So you went back to the other side and thought moisture levels would be different.  They're not...
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = How many times do you have to be told, moisture levels don't change very much over 100 feet of distance.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = De-humidifiers help keep the observatory area at lower levels of moisture.  Well inside the building they do anyway...
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = If you keep taking readings so close together you're going to get confused about where they came from since they're still the same.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = Apparently the bathroom inside the small lab was occupied.  You detect high concentrations of...well...stuff you weren't expecting.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = If you had a spectrometer you might be able tell what was inside these tanks but the moisture levels tell you nothing.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = There's a nice breeze here.  It's a pleasant day outside too.  Really would be lovely to visit the beach.  Oh, you're supposed to be taking readings but since they keep coming out the same you started daydreaming.
	KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Jet fuel spills in this area have made accurate moisture readings impossible here.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPH = After being chased from the R&D area by and angry researcher you thought you might get different readins by the hangar.  Nope.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = Weren't you told recently that readings don't really change over short distances?  If not, you're being told now.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = You'd guess there is jet fuel in the tanks but the hydrometer doesn't tell you anything other than it appears to be leaking.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = As with the round tank, there appears to be a jet fuel leak in the area since moisture readings are higher.  If you light a match you could confirm the spill...
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = This is a water tower.  There's so much water here you might as well be taking readings on the ocean.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = The engineer at the SPH said you'd have better luck over here but the readings haven't changed.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = You're stubbornly trying to find different readings of moisture levels in this area aren't you?
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = HEY LOOK!  The readings are exactly the same as by the North Dish!  That's amazing!
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = If you haven't been able to tell yet, the hydrometer is startng to get an attitude about giving the exact same readings to you over an over again.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You know, Kalbert Keinstein said insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and getting the same results.  Have you had your monthly psychological examination yet?
	KerbinSrfLandedVAB = Well the VAB is just as mosit as the SPH and R&D buildings and the Astronaut Complex and the Administration building and the runway and crawlerway and launch pad.  Are you seeing a pattern yet?
	KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = Perhaps you should go take readins by the tracking station hub in order to see how futile this measurement really is.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = YES!  THE READINGS ARE DIFFERENT HERE!  You measure a change in moisture levels of .000000001 percent.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = If you keep playing with it you're going to break it.  Nothing about the readings have changed.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex = Perhaps it wasn't made clear from any other result but NOTHING HAS CHANGED!!!!
	KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The instrument finally gives up.  A snap, crackle and pop sound emit from the electronics and a small wisp of smoke emanates from the hydrometer as it gives you one last reading that shows absolutely nothing has changed in the moisture levels at the KSC.
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = As the KSC sits on the coast near an ocean moisture readings are very high.

	KerbinSrfLanded = Readings indicate that there is moisture in the air in levels commiserate with the humidity of the region.
	KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Readings from here have revealed the presence of moisture in significant quantities.
	KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Cold temperatures have decreased the levels of moisture in the atmosphere significantly.
	KerbinSrfLandedMountains = As altitude increases, moisture levels are droping.
	KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The near desert conditions of the badlands causes a very low moisture reading.
	KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = It's the desert.  What did you expect?  A monsoon?
	KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Higher altitudes and lower temperatures creates an environment with lower moisture readings.
	KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The sub-zero temperatures of the poles has frozen the majority of moisture out of the air leading to desert like readings.
	KerbinSrfLandedShores = If you were to look up from the computer you'd realize there was a large body of water in front of you.  Moisture readings are elevated.
	KerbinSrfLandedWater = The scanner readouts reveal that you are IN THE WATER!!!!!!!!!
		KerbinFlyingLow = Comparision of the humidity data in flight to the moisture readings shows a direct correlation between the measurements of moisture and the measurements of moisture.
			KerbinFlyingHigh = Above 18km moisture readings drop of precipitously as the temperatures decrease rapidly the higher you go indicating that moisture is freezing out of the air.

	EveSrfLanded = You've never see readings quite like these revealing the presence of significant levels of hydrocarbons in the air.
	EveSrfLandedPoles = The lower temperatures at the poles has created conditions favorable to the formation of hydrocabons in liquid form on the surface and in the air.
	EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = Ok, it may not be a sea like you would think of pleasantly back home but IT IS STILL A BIG BODY OF LIQUID!  Of course readings are high...
	EveSrfLandedLowlands = The higher pressure of this area has caused puddles of hydrocarbons to form on the surface.  Lighting a match might be a bad idea...
	EveSrfLandedMidlands = As with water in the atmosphere back home, the levels of hydrocarbons in the air appears to drop off with increases in altidude.
	EveSrfLandedHighlands = Readings from this area confirm that higher altitudes and lower moisture readins have a direct correlation.
	EveSrfLandedPeaks = Another piece of the moisture puzzle fits together with readings from lower altitudes indicating decreases in moisture with higher altidudes.
	EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The sub-surface chemical composition is partially revealed with moisture readings from this area.
		EveFlyingLow = Readings in flight show the atmosphere could potentially be harvested for hydrocarbons.
			EveFlyingHigh = Lower levels of moisture are found at higher altitudes, yet the fantastic atmospheric pressure on this planet still allows detectable levels of liquid hydrocarbons.

	DunaSrfLanded = Low temperatures and a very thing atmosphere lead to extremely dry conditions around the planet.
	DunaSrfLandedHighlands = The higher altitudes of the highlands creates a nearly moisture free environment.
	DunaSrfLandedCraters = Even this close to the surface, atmospheric moisture readings are extremely low.
	DunaSrfLandedPoles = Water and frozen CO2 are present on the surface and sublimation causes this area to have far higher moisture readings than the rest of the planet.
	DunaSrfLandedLowlands = Levels in the soil are low but detectable however the atmospheric readings still show a marked lack of moisture.
	DunaSrfLandedMidlands = AN AMAZING DISCOVERY!!!  High levels of moisture have been found...oh.  Nevermind, someone evacuated the waste disposal tank...
		DunaFlyingLow = Moisture levels are so low as to be nearly undetectable due to the low pressure and temperatures around the planet.
			DunaFlyingHigh = Practically no moisture exists in the upper atmosphere as the pressure and temperatures prevent liquid from forming in the air.

	JoolFlyingLow = The stupendous pressure at these levels has made the atmosphere nearly soup like.  It would be more appropriate to say you were swimming than flying.
	JoolFlyingHigh = Even at the edge of the atmosphere, moisture levels are extremely high although it primarily consists of ammonia based compounds.

	LaytheSrfLanded = Almost the entire surface of the moon is covered in liquid water.  What kind of readings did you expect?  Dry?
	LaytheSrfLandedDunes = Although this area is desert like in appearance the moisture levels are through the roof thanks to the nearly ubiquitous presence of liquid water on the surface.
	LaytheSrfLandedShores = As with standing on the shores at home, if you look up, there's a giant body of water in front of you so moisture readings are low of course...NOT!
	LaytheSrfLandedPoles = Even at the poles water remains in liquid form and in high concentrations in the atmosphere lending support to the theory that high levels of salt are also present in the water.  Spectroscopic readings might be able to prove this theory conclusively.
	LaytheSrfLandedCrescentBay = It's still a giant body of water.  Did you think it was going to be dry?
	LaytheSrfLandedTheSaganSea = Sailing, sailing over The Sagan Sea, for many a rocket shall exlode ere Kerbin we will see!
		LaytheFlyingLow = At low altitudes the moisture readings are nearly the same as the surface but begin to drop off as altitude increases.
			LaytheFlyingHigh = As with other atmospheric bodies, moisture levels at high altidude drop off abruptly.
