	RESULTS
	{
	default = The arm exposes some material underneath the surface
	default = The scoop scrapes off the surface layer for analysis
	default = Images are taken of the exposed regolith

	MohoSrfLanded = That's the scoop beginning to melt
	MohoSrfLanded = KSC is more excited that the arm has not melted yet
	MohoSrfLandedNorthPole = The scoop arm will have a hard reaching into the Mohole

	EveSrfLanded = The soil has good composition for sampling, assuming you can take off and return one
	EveSrfSplashed = Sploosh!
	EveSrfSplashed = The arms splashes into the ocean. The water starts fizzing and steaming

		GillySrfLanded = The scoop disturbs a small amount of material which quickly floats away at escape velocity

	KerbinSrf = Mission Control notes that it will be cheaper to just send interns with shovels next time
	KerbinSrfSplashed = Sploosh!
	KerbinSrfSplashed = The engineering team briefly considers using the scoop as an oar
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = The extended arm trips over one of Dr. Kerman's assistants
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = KSC Police fines Mission Control for disturbing the landscaping and structures around the Space Center
	KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = There appears to be more sand under the sand
	KerbinSrfLandedShores = Oh look, there's some shiny seasonal seashells showing!
	KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The arm almost gets caught in some grass
	KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The scoop scratches the rocky surface
	KerbinSrfLandedTundra = There is thick ice under some fine snow
	KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The arm scoops up some shredded tire pieces and a strange green material

		MunSrfLanded = Mun regolith is dusty with scattered larger particles
		MunSrfLanded = The dusty topmost layer is several centimeters deep and could pose some difficulty for both walking and driving

		MinmusSrfLanded = Mission Control realizes that this is just a REALLY expensive ice cream scoop
		MinmusSrfLanded = Scientists ponder over images of the exposed material and conclude: Lime Sherbet

	DunaSrfLanded = The surface layer is very, very fine dust
	DunaSrfLanded = The scoop exposes darker dust just a few centimeters under the top layer
	DunaSrfLanded = Some bright material is exposed under the top layer, could it be ice?

		IkeSrfLanded = Ike soil is less dusty and more rocky
		IkeSrfLanded = The scoop scratches away at rocky material. A strong drill will be required to sample beneath the surface

	DresSrfLanded = There are striking similarities between Dres' and the Mun's  regolith

	JoolSrfLanded = The engineering team wins a top prize for developing a system that can scoop material from the surface of a gas giant!

		LaytheSrfLanded = The soil layers have similar properties to those of Kerbin
		LaytheSrfLanded = Given the amount of water on Laythe, having some soil to interact with is actually somewhat rare

		//VallSrfLanded =

		//TyloSrfLanded =

		//BopSrfLanded =

		//PolSrfLanded =

	EeelooSrfLanded = The scratching noise made by the scoop confirms that this is an icy surface
	EeelooSrfLanded = There are fine snowy particles on the surface, but it is mostly a solid chunk of ice
