	RESULTS
	{
		default = The instrument records impacts to estimate the density of micrometeorites at specific altitudes.
		default = You register several small micrometeorite collisions in a span of minutes. Perhaps you passed through some sort of debris field. 
		default = Woah! That last micrometeorite nearly punched through the detector! Perhaps we need thicker panels on future spacecraft.

		SunInSpace = Micrometeorite impacts are detected in higher quantities in solar orbit than in the orbits of planets, yet less impacts are detected than expected.
		SunInSpaceLow = At such a close distance from the Sun, there are very little impacts detected. 

		KerbinInSpace = The instrument records impacts to estimate the density of micrometeorites at specific altitudes around Kerbin.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = At lower orbits, micrometeorite impacts appear to be much more frequent.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = Woah! That last micrometeorite nearly punched through the detector! Perhaps we need thicker panels on future spacecraft.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The detector seems to detect less micrometeorite impacts than expected in higher orbits.

		MunInSpace = The instrument records impacts to estimate the density of micrometeorites at specific altitudes around the Mun. 
		MunInSpaceLow = Very little micrometeorite impacts are detected in low Munar orbit.
		MunInSpaceHigh = So far there seems to be less micrometeorite impacts around the Mun than around Kerbin.

		MinmusInSpace = The instrument records impacts to estimate the density of micrometeorites at specific altitudes around Minmus. 
		MinmusInSpaceLow = The loose dust cloud around Minmus seems to generate a lot of micrometeorite impacts. Use caution.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = There already seems too be a lot more micrometeorite impacts than expected in Minmus orbit.

		EarthInSpace = The instrument records impacts to estimate the density of micrometeorites at specific altitudes around Earth.
		EarthInSpaceLow = At lower orbits, micrometeorite impacts appear to be much more frequent.
		EarthInSpaceLow = Woah! That last micrometeorite nearly punched through the detector! Perhaps we need thicker panels on future spacecraft.
		EarthInSpaceHigh = The detector seems to detect less micrometeorite impacts than expected in higher orbits.

		MoonInSpace = The instrument records impacts to estimate the density of micrometeorites at specific altitudes around the Moon.
		MoonInSpaceLow = Very little micrometeorite impacts are detected in low Lunar orbit.
		MoonInSpaceHigh = So far there seems to be less micrometeorite impacts around the Moon than around Earth.
