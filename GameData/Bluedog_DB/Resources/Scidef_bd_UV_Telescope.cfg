	RESULTS
	{
	
	default = You take high resolution images in the ultraviolet wavelength.
	default = You snap a number of ultraviolet images.
	default = You take ultraviolet images of a distant celestial object.
	default = You take high resolution UV images of far away structures in space like stars, nebulae, and novae.
	default = Ultraviolet observations appear to reveal the discovery of long-period pulsars. Fascinating!


	KerbinInSpaceLow = You take an image of a distant deep sky object from low Kerbin orbit. It looks pretty and violet.
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbin's cloud layers are mapped in the UV wavelength, looking for weather patterns.
	KerbinInSpaceLow = You take high resolution UV images of far away structures in space like stars, nebulae, and novae.
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = You take high resolution UV images of far away structures in space like stars, nebulae, and novae.
	KerbinInSpaceLow = Ultraviolet observations appear to reveal the discovery of long-period pulsars. Fascinating!
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = Ultraviolet observations appear to reveal the discovery of long-period pulsars. Fascinating!
	
	EarthInSpaceLow = You take an image of a distant deep sky object from low Earth orbit. It looks pretty and violet.
	EarthInSpaceHigh = Earth's cloud layers are mapped in the UV wavelength, looking for weather patterns.
	EarthInSpaceLow = You take high resolution UV images of far away structures in space like stars, nebulae, and novae.
	EarthInSpaceHigh = You take high resolution UV images of far away structures in space like stars, nebulae, and novae.
	EarthInSpaceLow = Ultraviolet observations appear to reveal the discovery of long-period pulsars. Fascinating!
