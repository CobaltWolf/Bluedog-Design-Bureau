	RESULTS
	{
		default = All's quiet. Looks like nothing's going t- PING!
		default = There might have been an impact recently, but you weren't paying attention.
		default = The hole beside the impactor COULD be a test result but you're too busy stopping explosive decompression to find out.

		KerbinInSpaceLow = IMPACT... looks like everything is still in one piece, thankfully. It seems that spacecraft can survive debris impacts, but we should make sure our vessels are shielded.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = When the mun hits your eye like a big pizza pie...that's an impact!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The detector has logged fewer impacts since attaining a higher orbit.

		MunInSpaceLow = It appears the Mun had a smaller moon orbiting it - oh. It's gone.
		MunInSpaceHigh = So those tiny pinging sounds?  Yeah, that was your science result announcing its arrival.

		MinmusInSpaceLow = Based on recent impacts, you believe Minmus is challenging you to a snowball fight.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = All these tiny paticles kind of reminds you of sprinkles on an ice cream cone...

		MohoInSpaceLow = Kerbol must have blasted a piece of rock off Moho.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = We've discovered a new body orbiting Moho and we're calling it Mohoteor...uh...well, it was there for an instant.

		EveInSpaceLow = Whoa! Looks like the detector just passed through a meteor shower!
		EveInSpaceHigh = Purple planets, purple clouds, purple dust...what the hell are they putting in the food?

		GillyInSpaceLow = That might have been Gilly's even smaller brother...
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Was the rock that just hit you smaller or larger than Gilly?  Not sure...

		DunaInSpaceLow = Yikes! It seems you weren't expecting that impact... or were you?
		DunaInSpaceHigh = It seems like dunaroids are just like any other meteroid.  Hard as rock and out to kill you at every opportunity

		IkeInSpaceLow = You ask Wehrner if that was the famous magic boulder... Or at least a piece of it.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Well Ike is here but I don't see Mike anywhere.  What's that splatter on the detector?

		DresInSpaceLow = You stopped counting the number of impacts soon after you arrived at Dres.
		DresInSpaceHigh = If Dres isn't trying to kill you why are there 42 hull patches and no hits on the detector?

		JoolInSpaceLow = It seems that the orbits of any small debris decayed into the gas giant long ago- PING!
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Apparently even the particles are bigger at Jool...

		LaytheInSpaceLow = That impact seemed decidedly... moist.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = It appears that Laythe has offcially sneezed on your detector.  Congratulations on being to first to discover space boogers!

		VallInSpaceLow = Yet another impact... so what?
		VallInSpaceHigh = In sector 637-K the particles are fine and grainy but here they are more coarse.  I think we found...dirt!

		TyloInSpaceLow = The device measures a large impact, followed by many smaller impacts.
		TyloInSpaceHigh = That sound was not the result of an impact but rather was directly caused by space food.  KLANG!  THAT was in impact!

		BopInSpaceLow = Flight, Mission Control. You did not, in fact, just collide with Bop.
		BopInSpaceHigh = Mission Control, Flight.  Did we just collode with Bop?

		PolInSpaceLow = Judging from the impact, we may have impacted something crystalline in nature.
		PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, polled politely, properly produced predicted principles of impacts.

		EelooInSpaceLow = Even out here, it seems spacecraft have to deal with space debris.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = We came, we saw, we got hit by more rocks.

		AsteroidInSpaceLow = Pieces of the asteroid seem to have broken off from the activity around it...
		AsteroidInSpaceHigh = WAIT!  No one said anything about rocks around the rock.
		AsteroidSrfLanded = The detector pings angrily as it is pelted from the debris of our landing.
