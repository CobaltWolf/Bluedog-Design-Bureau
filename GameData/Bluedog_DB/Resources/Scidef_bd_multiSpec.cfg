		IoInSpaceHigh = Wow! Thermal emission analysis reveals a hot and angry body. Io seems to be heated by Jupiter's strong tidal forces and internal geological activity.

		EuropaInSpace = Multispectral imagery is taken of Europa.
		EuropaInSpaceLow = Multispectral compositional analysis reveals a surface composed of silicate rock and water-ice.
		EuropaInSpaceLow = Images taken in several wavelengths reveal a smooth surface with far less craters than expected. This indicates a young surface that some geological process refreshed it recently or is continuing to refresh it in the present.
		EuropaInSpaceLowLineaments = Spectral data collected from Europa's lineaments puzzle scientists. While we expected tholins, it seems these brown regions might be radiation bombarded magnesium sulfate and sulfric acid salts, perhaps surfacing from a subterranean ocean!
		EuropaInSpaceHigh = Albedo data reveals Eeloo is mostly composed of highly reflective ice with streaks of a less reflective, brown material.
		EuropaInSpaceHigh = Multispectral spectrometry analysis reveals a thin exosphere of oxygen and water vapor. This is potentially being replenished by active cryovolcanism errupting from an underground ocean.

		GanymedeInSpaceHigh = Multispectral images reveal a incredibly large body. If this body was not in orbit of Jupiter, we would surely consider it a planet in its own right.
		GanymedeInSpaceHigh = Despite our initial observations, spectral analysis suggests a very tenuous oxygen exosphere. It's likely the high levels of jovian radiation causes surface ice to be split into hydrogen and oxygen, forming this exosphere. 
	
		CallistoInSpace = Multispectral images are taken around Callisto.
		CallistoInSpaceLow = Spectral analysis reveals Callisto's surface to be an almost 50-50 split of water ice and rocky materials. 
		CallistoInSpaceLow = Callisto's surface is absolutely and utterly covered in surface craters. Callisto almost certainly has not undergone any active geological activity in some time, leaving it with an incredibly old surface!
		CallistoInSpaceLowValhallaCrater = Images are taken of Callisto's Valhalla Crater. This appears to be the largest multi-ringed crater we know of in the solar system. It is deep enough to reveal a glimpse under Callisto's surface material, and spectral analysis suggests Callisto's interior is not differentiated from its surface. This would mean Callisto is one of the largest bodies we know of with an undifferentiated interior.
		CallistoInSpaceHigh = Light reflectivity and emission data reveal an incredibly curious body. This is definitely one of the surfaces with the most varied albedo we know of. Most of surface consists of an almost black, low-albedo material, riddled with spots of white, high-albedo material.

		EnceladusInSpaceLowSouthernPolarRegion = Spectral images capture plumes of water errupting from Enceladus' southern polar region.
		EnceladusInSpaceHigh = The fresh, clean ice coating Enceladus' surface makes it one of the most high albedo objects in the solar system.
		EnceladusInSpaceHigh = Images revealing geysers of water vapor errupting from Enceladus' surface. Spectrometry analysis shows that its almost identitical to the composition of Saturn's E ring, suggesting that frozen water vapor that escaped from Enceladus supplies most of the material that makes up the E ring.

		TitanInSpace = Multispectral images are taken around Titan.
		TitanInSpaceLow = Titan's thick atmosphere and cloud layers seem to reflect a significant amount of light, making it difficult for this instrument to learn much about Titan's surface.
		TitanInSpaceLow = At lower orbits, multispectral images can glimpse peaks of certain features of Titan's surface, but they are largely obscured by Titan's thick atmosphere.
		TitanInSpaceHigh = Thermal emission analysis shows that Titan's extremely thick acts as an insulator, trapping a great deal of heat and keeping it warm.
		TitanInSpaceHigh = Titan's thick, nitrogen-rich atmosphere is highly opaque, meaning little light from Titan's surface is able to reach this instrument.

	UranusInSpace = Multispectral images are captured of Uranus.
	UranusInSpaceLow = In visible light, Uranus appears rather bland and featureless. However in the ultraviolet and infrared spectrums, Uranus appears to look much more interesting, and useful data is able to be learned about its weather systems. Uranus looks paticurally tasty in UV, making it appear to look almost like cotton candy.
	UranusInSpaceLow = Spectral analysis captures the composition of the ices in its atmosphere to be largely ammonia, water, ammonium hydrosulfide, and interestingly, methane hydrate.
	UranusInSpaceHigh = Multispectral images are captured of Uranus, revealing a smooth teal ball, reminding some of our scientists of a bowling ball.

		TritonInSpaceLow = Multispectral data is used to create false color images, depicting Triton as a colorful and bright mix of pink, blue, yellow, and green.
		TritonInSpaceLow = Images show Triton to have a noticeably varied surface. Triton has an older region with ridges and streaks (which scientists call the 'cantaloupe', as it looks like the texture of a cantaloupe), younger regions with lakes of frozen nitrogen and dark spots indicating cryovolcanic ash, and a number of other interesting features. Triton seems to hide a lot more surprises than we initially expected.
		TritonInSpaceHigh = Images taken of Triton reveal a MUCH more interesting and varied body than expected. Scientists suspect Triton is not a typical moon, but instead a dwarf planet that Neptune captured from the Kupier Belt with a thin nitrogen exosphere. If Triton was not orbitting Neptune, it would be the largest dwarf planet (modestly larger than Pluto) and possibly a planet in its own right.
		TritonInSpaceHigh = Thermal emissions reveal warm, localized hot spots. Imaging analysis reveal a younger surface with few craters as well as some strange dark spots on the surface, corresponding with the localized hot spots. This information indicates active cryovolcanism. Interesting!

	PlutoInSpace = Multispectral images are taken around Pluto.
	PlutoInSpaceLow = Pluto's surface is a geological goldmine. Mountains, dunes, plains, frozen lakes, cryovolcanoes, and more are spotted in images. Some of our scientists say Pluto is the second most geologically complex body in the solar system, with Earth being the only body with a higher level of geological complexity.
	PlutoInSpaceLow = Imagery show penitentes in certain areas on Pluto's surface. These ice formations are incredibly rare in the solar system, previously believed to only occur on Earth.
	PlutoInSpaceLowSputnikPlanum = A high-albedo, smooth, and young region of nitrogen ice known as Sputnik Planitia is captured in multispectral images. If you zoom out a little bit, it almost looks like a heart.

	PlutoInSpaceLowMontes = Pluto's montes appear taller, sharp, and rugged, which suggests they are younger formations not yet erroded by time.
	PlutoInSpaceHigh = Wow! We expected a boring gray ball of ice but Pluto is super interesting! Its surface seems to be divided between high-albedo, brighter, younger, and smoother regions of nitrogen ice, and low-albedo, darker, older, and rugged regions of tholins.
	PlutoInSpaceHigh = An extremely thin atmosphere is detected around Pluto, largely composed of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. This is likely being produced by the sublimation of ice and cryovolcanism.

		CharonInSpaceLowArgoChasma = Scientists are shocked when images come in from Argo Chasma. It is interesting to find such a impressive feature on an unassuming body. Images reveal that Argo Chasma is the deepest canyon ever found in the solar system to date.
		CharonInSpaceHigh = Imagery reveals Charon to largely be a gray moon with a red north polar cap.
		CharonInSpaceHigh = Pluto's large moon Charon is captured in multispectral imagery. Charon could be considered a dwarf planet in its own right, and its mass and size make the Pluto-Charon system more similar to a binary system than a planet-moon system.
