	RESULTS
	{
	default = You take high resolution images in the X-ray wavelength, hoping to get some cool stars in them.
	default = You snap a number of X-ray images. Unfortunately you can't seem to see through everything, as you had hoped.
	default = You take X-ray images of a distant object. It's still just a little bright dot as far as you can tell.
	default = The imaging device confirms that the nearby stars all emit their own X-rays, each with its own unique signature.
	default = The X-ray data shows what the eggheads call a 'dark star'. You presume they're talking about star-shaped christmas chocolates.
