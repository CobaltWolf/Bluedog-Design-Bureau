	RESULTS
	{
		default = You collect data on trapped belts of ions and electrons. 
		default = You analyze the flow of charged particles and the belts they are confined to. 
		default = This instrument searches for radiation belt formations.

		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The trapped radiation around Kerbin seems primarily to run along Kerbin's magnetic field lines.

		MunInSpace = No trapped radiation belts are detected around the Mun.
		MunInSpaceLow = The lack of radiation belts around the Mun indicate its weak magnetic field is not strong enough to redirect charged particles to form a radiation belt.
		MunInSpaceHigh = While radiation is detected around the Mun, none of it appears to be orginating from a radiation belt.
		
		MinmusinSpace = No trapped radiation belts are detected around Minmus.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = The lack of radiation belts around Minmus indicate its weak magnetic field is not strong enough to redirect charged particles to form a radiation belt.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = While radiation is detected around the Minmus, none of it appears to be orginating from a radiation belt.

		MohoInSpaceLow = Even at closer distances, Moho lacks any notable radiation belt.
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Almost all the ions and electron particles originate from Kerbol, not from any belt of trapped radiation around Moho.

		EveinSpace = Radiation belts stronger than Kerbin's Van Kerman belts are detected.

		EveInSpaceLow = The instrument detects a great amount of electrons and ions being directed along Eve's strong magnetic field lines.

		DunaInSpace = Duna does not seem to have any significant belts of trapped radiation.
		DunaInSpaceLow = The lack of any discernable belts of trapped ions and electrons suggest Duna's magnetic field is quite weak.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = Radiation is detected, however it is not originating from any belts of trapped radiation.

		DresInSpace = The instrument refuses to preform measurements, as it is unhappy with being sent to Dres.
		DresInSpaceLow = Nothing. Nada. 
		
		JoolInSpace = Extremely strong belts of radiation are detected around Jool!

		LaytheInSpaceHigh = Laythe seems to have its own radiation belt in addition to being within Jool's radiation belt.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = The amount of radiation due to Laythe's belt of trapped ions and electrons is only compounded by the radiation resulting from being within Jool's radiation belt.
		VallInSpace = Vall does not possess any radiation belts, suggesting it has no magnetic field.
		VallInSpaceLow = The only trapped radiation here seems to be coming from Jool itself.
		VallInSpaceHigh = Vall sits squarely in the middle of Jool's radiation belt is subjected to a constant barrage of charged ions and electrons.

		PolInSpace = Pol does not possess any radiation belts, suggesting it has no magnetic field.
		PolInSpaceLow = No trapped ions and electrons from Pol are detected.
		PolInSpaceHigh = Pol is comfortably outside of Jool's primary radiation belt and is therefore subject to less charged particles from Jool's radiation belts than Jool's other moons.

		EelooInSpace = Eeloo does not seem to possess any noticable belts of trapped radiation.	
		EelooInSpaceLow = Even closer to Eeloo, no radiation belts are detected suggesting that Eeloo does not have a magnetic field.

		CallistoInSpaceLow = No trapped ions and electrons from Callisto are detected.
		CallistoInSpaceHigh = Callisto is comfortably outside of Jupiter's primary radiation belt and is therefore subject to less charged particles from Jupiter's radiation belts than Jupiter's other moons.

		TitanInSpaceLow = Titan's belt of trapped radiation indicates Saturn induces Titan's magnetic field.
		TitanInSpaceHigh = Even though Titan possesses a radiation belt, levels of trapped radiation should be higher as Titan orbits in one of the stronger regions of Saturn's radiation belt. Perhaps Titan's induced magnetic field deflects a lot of this trapped radiation?
