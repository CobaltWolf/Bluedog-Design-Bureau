	RESULTS
	{
	default = Radiation emitted in the microwave L-band gives a clear indication of the levels of water in the top layers of the surface.
	KerbinInSpaceLow = L-band microwave emissions indicate high levels of water content across most of Kerbin's surface.
	KerbinInSpaceLow = Measurements of Kerbin's oceans reveal areas of very high salinity in the warm, tropical waters.
	MunInSpaceLow = Significant water content is detected in several of the Mun's deeper craters and in its polar regions.
	MinmusInSpaceLow = Microwave emissions indicate that Minmus' frozen surface is at least partially made up of water.
	SunInSpaceLow = The microwave antennae appear to be melting, providing no usable data.
	MohoInSpaceLow = Only the sun's background microwave radiation is detectable in orbit around Moho.
	EveInSpaceLow = Eve's oceans have very high salinity levels, likely arising from a number of different salt compounds.
	EveInSpaceLow = Eve's surface contains significant levels of soil moisture in its low lying areas.
	GillyInSpaceLow = No detectable water emissions are found in orbit around Gilly.
	DunaInSpaceLow = Trace levels of water are detected in much of Duna's upper surface; higher levels are recorded near the poles.
	IkeInSpaceLow = Minor emissions of microwave radiation suggest that a few regions of Ike's surface contain water.
	DresInSpaceLow = Drier than Kerbin's deserts, in fact, there doesn't appear to be any signal coming from Dres, not even background levels.
	JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's lack of a detectable surface suggests that the microwave emissions detected here arise from some other source.
	LaytheInSpaceLow = Surprisingly low levels of microwave emissions are detected coming from Laythe's surface, suggesting that its oceans have little water content.
	LaytheInSpaceLow = The low water content of Laythe's oceans prevents any meaningful salinity measurements from being made.
	VallInSpaceLow = Vall's outer surface appears to contain little but water, only its mountainous regions show lower concentrations.
	TyloInSpaceLow = Microwave emissions from some of Tylo's impact craters suggest that surface has been pummeled by water-rich asteroids and comets.
	BopInSpaceLow = Few microwave signals are recorded over Bop's surface; there are some curiously strong L-band signals coming from Bop's northern polar region however, further study is warranted...
	PolInSpaceLow = Some nearly imperceptible microwave emissions suggest that Pol is largely devoid of any surface-level moisture content.
	EelooInSpaceLow = No microwave signals are recorded over Eeloo's frosty white surface, suggesting that it is something other than water ice.
	SarnusInSpaceLow = Intense microwave signals are detected from Sarnus, likely originating from water in its atmosphere.
	HaleInSpaceLow = Scans of the surface reveal it to be composed mostly of water ice.
	OvokInSpaceLow = Emissions from the surface indicate that it is composed of little but water.
	SlateInSpaceLow = Very high levels of sub-surface moisture content are detected during low orbit scans of Slate.
	TektoInSpaceLow = Only low levels of microwave emissions are detected from Tekto's surface, and indication that its oceans and surface contain little water.
	UrlumInSpaceLow = Strong microwave emissions are detected coming from Urlum; a sign of high water concentrations.
	PoltaInSpaceLow = The surface of Polta appears to contain very high levels of water, most likely as dirty, sub-surface ice deposits.
	PriaxInSpaceLow = Priax appears to have a mostly dry surface; it is possibly some type of captured asteroid.
	WalInSpaceLow = Readings from the surface of Wal show significant levels of sub-surface water deposits.
	TalInSpaceLow = The surface of Tal contains significant levels of water.
	NeidonInSpaceLow = Microwave emissions are detected from what is believed to be Neidon's icy interior.
	ThatmoInSpaceLow = Significant levels of water are detected in microwave scans of Thatmo.
	NisseeInSpaceLow = The chalky moon Nissee appears to be mostly dry based on microwave scanning.
	PlockInSpaceLow = Strong microwave emissions hint at levels of sub-surface water on Plock.
	KarenInSpaceLow = No significant microwave emissions are detected from orbit around Karen.
	MercuryInSpaceLow = Only the sun's background microwave radiation is detectable in orbit around Mercury.
	VenusInSpaceLow = Venus' surface contains no detectable levels of soil moisture in its low lying areas.
	MoonInSpaceLow = Significant water content is detected in several of the Moon's deeper craters and in its polar regions.
	MarsInSpaceLow = Trace levels of water are detected in much of Mars' upper surface; higher levels are recorded near the poles.
	DeimosInSpaceLow = No detectable water emissions are found in orbit around Deimos.
	PhobosInSpaceLow = Minor emissions of microwave radiation suggest that a few regions of Phobos' surface contain water.
	JupiterInSpaceLow = Jupiter's lack of a detectable surface suggests that the microwave emissions detected here arise from some other source.
	IoInSpaceLow = Some nearly imperceptible microwave emissions suggest that Io is largely devoid of any surface-level moisture content.
	EuropaInSpaceLow = Europa's outer surface appears to contain little but water, with signs of very high salinity below the surface.
	GanymedeInSpaceLow = Very high levels of sub-surface moisture content are detected during low orbit scans of Ganymede.
	CallistoInSpaceLow = Microwave emissions from some of Callisto's impact craters suggest that surface has been pummeled by water-rich asteroids and comets.
	SaturnInSpaceLow = Intense microwave signals are detected from Saturn, likely originating from water in its atmosphere.
	TitanInSpaceLow = Only low levels of microwave emissions are detected from Titan's surface, and indication that its oceans and surface contain little water.
	UranusInSpaceLow = Strong microwave emissions are detected coming from Uranus; a sign of high water concentrations.
	PlutoInSpaceLow = Scans of the surface reveal it to contain very high concentrations of water ice.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = Nothing is detected in microwave scans of this asteroid, indicating that no water is present.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = Microwave emissions from this asteroid suggest that it is completely devoid of any water.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowIcy-Organic = Significant levels of water are detected in microwave emissions coming from this asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowCarbonaceous = Trace levels of water are detected in the surface of this asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowComet = High levels of water are deteced in scans of this comet's surface.
