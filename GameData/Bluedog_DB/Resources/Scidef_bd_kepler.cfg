	RESULTS
	{

	default = The instrument detects a subtle dip in brightness of a distant star, light-years away. This indicates the discovery of a new exoplanet!
	default = The instrument measures a large change in brightness of an observed star, indicating either a large gas giant exoplanet or a binary planetary system have transited the star.
	default = Long, periodic instances of dimming are observed in a distant red giant. This is a rare discovery with data suggesting this system has had a large planetary collision, resulting in a large, scattered debris field forming a temporary asteroid belt around the star. 
	default = Collected data from this instrument has made an important discovery! Because of this instrument, scientists now can confirm that planets outnumber stars in our galaxy. While this seems inuitive, this could not be conclusively proven until several exoplanetary transits were observed. 
	default = A wide field of stars are being monitored by this instrument for exoplanet transits. Currently none are being observed but a transit could happen at any moment. Best keep your eyes peeled!
	default = A transit is observed around a Sun-like star of a possibly rocky planet. Could this be a habitable planet? Only future scientific investigations can tell.  

	KerbinInSpaceLow = The bright glow of Kerbin's surface and its exosphere seems to be diminishing the effectiveness of this instument. Perhaps it would function better in a higher orbit?
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = While observational data seems to be better than if they were collected in low orbit, it seems Kerbin's magnetosphere is able to effect the highly sensitive instrument and reduce the instruments maximum effectiveness. Perhaps it would be best to take measurements outside of Kerbin's orbit?
	KerbinInSpace = The instrument seems to be functioning at an adequate capacity in Kerbin orbit. Just try to avoid pointing it at Kerbin or Kerbol, as that would cause the instrument's sensitive CCD to be rendered unoperable.

	SunInSpaceLow = Way too close to the sun! The intense magnetic field and brightness of the sun seem to be massively interfering with the highly sensitive instrument, rendering it practically unusable.
	SunInSpace = The instrument detects a subtle dip in brightness of a distant star, light-years away. This indicates the discovery of a new exoplanet!
	SunInSpace = The instrument measures a large change in brightness of an observed star, indicating either a large gas giant exoplanet or a binary planetary system have transited the star.

	SunInSpace = A transit is observed around a Sun-like star of a possibly rocky planet. Could this be a habitable planet? Only future scientific investigations can tell. 
	SunInSpace = It seems that this instrument operates best in a solar orbit rather than an orbit around a planetary body. Just don't point it at the Sun, you'll fry the instrument! 

	EarthInSpaceLow = The bright glow of Earth's surface and its exosphere seems to be diminishing the effectiveness of this instument. Perhaps it would function better in a higher orbit?
	EarthInSpaceHigh = While observational data seems to be better than if they were collected in low orbit, it seems Earth's magnetosphere is able to effect the highly sensitive instrument and reduce the instruments maximum effectiveness. Perhaps it would be best to take measurements outside of Earth's orbit?
	EarthInSpace = The instrument seems to be functioning at an adequate capacity in Earth orbit. Just try to avoid pointing it at Earth or the Sun, as that would cause the instrument's sensitive CCD to be rendered unoperable.
