	description = Kerbal High Kommand has decided to begin exploring options for a permanent, manned presence in space. It is believed a manned presence in space will prove to be the ultimate surveillance and defense in space, needed to keep those Krussians under control. However for some strange, unfathomable reason, they want us to demonstrate the necessary systems and maneuvers first.&br;&br;The first phase of this new 'Leo' program is to demonstrate that we can launch several spacecraft up into orbit and have them dock to each other. Therefore, your first task is to launch an unmanned target vessel into a nice round orbit, including a docking port, and await further instructions.

	description = Well done on the successful launch of the Leo ATV. Now it's time for the real deal. We want you to launch a capsule manned by at least 2 Kerbals and achieve several objectives:&br;&br;1. Dock the new, manned capsule with the ATV.&br;2. Perform several experiments.&br;3. Collect the experiments from the ATV by EVA.&br;4.Return the manned capsule back home, including the collected science.&br;&br;If you fail, we will ofcourse deny any involvement, Jeb has a reputation for doing rogue launches with spare rockets anyway. Oh and please get rid of the ATV afterwards, the targeting systems of any future Leo systems might get confused otherwise. Good luck!
