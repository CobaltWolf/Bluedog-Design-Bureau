	description = Bob just came running into mission control, screaming Eureka and completely ruining our traditional lunchtime poker game. After he finally calmed down - with a little help from a straightjacket - he finally told us what the fuss is about. Bob thinks he's discovered the next best thing - after Mint icecream of course. It's this new concept called 'lithobraking'. He swears that it's the ultimate way to explore any other celestial surfaces out there that aren't covered by an atmosphere. The idea is simple: instead of spending precious fuel and cargo capacity on slowing down before landing, we could simply use the surface itself to slow our spacecraft down. This would mean huge savings and allow for simpler design, thereby reducing risk of errors.&br;&br;Even though some of the less inebriated among us have raised doubts about Bob's idea, the prospect of having more pocket money left for icecream is simply irresistible. So we want you to test this idea by throwing a probe at @targetBody. Do collect some science along the way though, just so we can have some data to show for it regardless.
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Launch a Burke probe to @targetBody and perform experiments before attempting a lithobraking maneuver.</color>
	notes = In assembly, use the tag 'Ranger' to find components fitting for this mission.
    completedMessage = So, perhaps that didn't quite work out after all. Good thing you got some data still.
