## Toroidal Aerospikes
Two options have been provided for the stock aerospike. The active one is (of course) #1 (left). It's as easy as swapping the digit in the config file (see `PlumeParty/Configs/stockRocketsUpper.config` for active config) to change the active plume. Note that there is a third effect in plume #1 and no altenate for it. Don't mind it.

Plumes for other aerospikes will be provided on an on-demand basis as aerospikes can come in various proportions.
