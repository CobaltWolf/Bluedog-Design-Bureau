## Generic Plumes
To hopefully prevent the overuse of certain other plume families on rocket engines (or to keep a sense of specialty and class about them) the generic flames are availed. These five unique flames are fit for many use cases. **Popcorn** and **Olympus** are vacuum flames while the other three are lifters and sustainers.
