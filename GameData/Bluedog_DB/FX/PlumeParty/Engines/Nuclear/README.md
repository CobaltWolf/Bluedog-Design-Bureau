## Nuclear
A wide and astounding set of plumes for atomic engines. Four for jets and four for rockets. The engine models in the images below show the use case of each plume. The **Firefly** and **Diesel** plumes are fit for use on rocket engines. The Turbo Nuk sets are cousins of the **Turbo Color** plumes for afterbuning jet engines.
