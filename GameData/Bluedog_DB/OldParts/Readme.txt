This folder contains soft deprecated old parts. They are hidden in the VAB but any craft and craft files using these parts will load. If you have gotten rid of all old parts, or if using a fresh save, this folder can be safely deleted.

Note that all parts in this folder will be permanently deleted in a future update in any case. It is a good idea to retire craft using parts in this folder.

Extra care should be taken with deleting the Science and ProbeExpansion folder, which contain common generic parts for long-term craft.
