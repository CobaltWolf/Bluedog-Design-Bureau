	manufacturer = Bluedog Design Bureau
	description =  Adapted version of the Landvermesser probe core to serve as an orbital probe. Includes increased propellant for its 3 vernier engines (Sold separately) and the control thrusters mounted on the solar panels (Also sold separately). A camera (Again, sold separately) replaces the solid rocket motor, so doesn't include a decoupler, and uses the verniers for orbital insertion instead.
