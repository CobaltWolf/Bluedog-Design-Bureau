	description =  A double stacked version of the "Rorat" probe bus. It includes expanded storage for monopropellant fuel, for use with the included attitude control thrusters or giving extra margin for course correction maneuvers. The extra space was also used - finally - to add some batteries to the core... They're not very big, though.
