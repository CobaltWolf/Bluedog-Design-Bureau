	description = An extended version of the SR-1 "Jekyll" probe core. This is a purely scientific satellite, possessing none of the reconnaissance equipment that SR-1 used. Includes experiments to study solar UV and X-Ray emissions, along with other solar activity. This satellite pushes this probe design's scientific capabilities to its limits. That being said, the large amount of experiments on this satellite comes at the cost of science value. It is designed to be launched as a secondary (or tertiary) payload, but it can also be launched by itself. Includes a built in decoupler as well as antennas.
