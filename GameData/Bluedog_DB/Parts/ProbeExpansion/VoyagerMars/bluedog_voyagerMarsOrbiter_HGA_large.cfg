	description = This upgraded high gain antenna for the Nomad orbiter is as wide as the probe itself! Attaches to the same point as the standard high gain dish but folds underneath instead. Features cutouts for the spacecraft adapter attachement points and the engines. Hopefully the holes dont affect the perfomance too much! Features homeworld tracking.
