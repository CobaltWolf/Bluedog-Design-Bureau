	manufacturer = Bluedog Design Bureau
	description = Engineers at Bluedog Design Bureau found some old blueprints for some kind of over-engineered grabbing device in the dumpster behind a competitor. These documents were studied and revised, and then subsequently thrown in the dumpster again. Later an intern found the discarded designs and they were finally adapted to make a sleek 0.625m grapple unit that can be used for all sorts of applications. While originally solely created for asteroid rendezvous missions, this grapple unit can be modified for missions that have non-asteroid targets.
