	description = Primitive, spin stabilized bus designed to serve as an experimental weather satellite. It mounts two television cameras, one with a wide field of view and another with a narrow lens. Placing it in a low orbit will allow it to relay images of things like hurricanes back to KSC, providing early warning to communities in the areas it can see.

	real_description = TIROS-1 (or TIROS-A) was the first successful low-Earth orbital weather satellite, and the first of a series of Television Infrared Observation Satellites. It mounts two television cameras, one with a wide field of view and another with a narrow lens. Placing it in a low orbit will allow it to relay images of things like hurricanes back to KSC, providing early warning to communities in the areas it can see.
