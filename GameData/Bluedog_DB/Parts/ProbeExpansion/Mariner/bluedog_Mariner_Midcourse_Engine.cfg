	description  = A small monopropellant powered engine with an internal fuel supply, not enough for large orbital maneuvers but sufficient for adjusting an encounter trajectory. Originally based on the Burke satellite engine, this engine has an expanded fuel reserve and a slightly larger range of attitude control. Interestingly, this engine was designed to be mounted on the side of various Argo satellites. Attitude control is accomplished through jet vanes mounted inside the nozzle. <#ef7b06> AUTHOR'S NOTE: Includes a control point to help use the engine in a side-mounted configuration.</color>
