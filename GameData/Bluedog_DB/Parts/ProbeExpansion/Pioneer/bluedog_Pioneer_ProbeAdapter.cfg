	description = A relatively tall 0.625m payload separation mechanism that was originally designed for mating Staara-37 Solid Rocket Motors to payloads on Daleth rockets. The extra height can house the top half of the Staara-37, and the extra height can also fit some aft-mounted equipment on your payload. Also used with one of the Pilgrim-PNR10X mission proposals where it is used to mate the Pilgrim-PNR10X spacecraft to a Staara-37FNV Solid Rocket Motor.

The extra height can house the top half of the Star-37, and the extra height can also fit some aft-mounted equipment on your payload. Used with the Pioneer SUAE mission proposal where it is used to mate the spacecraft to a Star-37FMV Solid Rocket Motor.
