	description = These hardy solar panels were designed for interplanetary flybys and provide both power and micrometeorite protection! The panels are deployable and though they do not track, they can be individually oriented to the sun via a deploy limit in the part action window. Place 12 radially around the Hokulani-LWWS Light Wet Workshop underneath the aero shield.
