	description = Kerbin's atmosphere, while protecting us from solar radiation, also blocks out many spectra that would be useful for astronomy. The ground stations we've been establishing on other bodies are a great opporunity to set up an ultra violet telescope outside the atmosphere.  Must be brought in cargo storage and deployed on the surface by a kerbal.
