	description = Similar to ultraviolet rays, cosmic radio rays are hampered by our atmosphere. By placing one (or an array of several, if you want to be accurate) on the far side of another body, our planet's radio transmissions would be shielded and cosmic radio sources made far easier to detect. Must be brought in cargo storage and deployed on the surface by a kerbal.
