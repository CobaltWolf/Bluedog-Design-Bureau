	description = This 0.125m probe core is derived from the Pathfinder-1 "Sienno" probe core. Instead of Pathfinder-1's geiger counter, Pathfinder-BCN houses an inflatable "balloon" experiment for use in space. This experiment is intended to make atmospheric density measurements in Kerbin orbit. Also has a small apogee kick motor built into the nose as well as an omni antenna.
