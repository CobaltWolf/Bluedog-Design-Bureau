	title = Perform a photographic study of @targetBody.
	description = Our space program is going well, we even dare say it's doing better than ever - don't let the insurance company tell you otherwise. We have even been quite succesful in our studies of @targetBody. However, somehow those nefarious Krussians have been one step ahead of us the whole time. The top brass has decided this cannot be allowed to continue and have told us we should start making plans for a manned landing of @targetBody. They also told us that whoever goes there, should return back home as well - for some reason they seem to think there's such a thing as a reputation to uphold.&br;&br;Anyhow, what this means is we will first need to scout @targetBody and find several places suitable for a safe landing. We've decided the best way to do this is to simply send a probe with a throwaway Kolaroid cam to convince the brass that there's plenty of flat space to land on.
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Launch a Kreuznach probe into the specified orbits around @targetBody and perform the requested experiments.</color>
	notes = In assembly, use the tag 'Lunar Orbiter' to find components fitting for this mission.
    completedMessage = Good job! All those blurry monochrome images will surely make it look sufficiently flat to be convincing.
