    name = BDB_GeoStudy
    group = BluedogDB
    genericTitle = Perform a Geophysical study
    genericDescription = Perform a Geophysical study from orbit of a planet or moon.
	
	title = Perform a Geophysical study from orbit of @targetBody.
	description = Previous studies of @targetBody have shown all kinds of strange things happening on and above the surface. Being an enterprising space program, naturally we proposed to send over one of our test dum...ahem pilots right away. Sadly the board declined our proposal, on the grounds that it's unethical to land Kerbals without a return plan. Bah, bureaucrats. Instead, you are hereby tasked with sending an unmanned probe into a polar orbit of @targetBody to conduct a set of experiments and transmit their results back to us. If we can make up the results with just the right phrasing, we just might get to do a manned mission after all - you ARE with us on this, right?
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Launch an OOG satellite into space around @targetBody and perform the requested experiments.</color>
	notes = In assembly, use the tag 'OGO' to find components fitting for this mission.
    completedMessage = Excellent! All these results show nothing anomalous, or even anything we didn't yet know at all! Start prepping those interns, we got flights to plan.
