	title = Aim at @targetBody and miss.
	description = We are pretty sure that there's more planets out there than what we've encountered so far. At least, Wernher swears he's seen a bright, colored speck in the sky that should be a nearby planet. He's even gone and gave it a name already, @targetBody. We at mission control figure, if it's out there, we gotta go there. You never know, there may be cookies we haven't tasted yet and what kind of Kerbals would we be if we didn't want to find out? It should be obvious to you by now, but we're telling you to go take a look. Fly to @targetBody and get close enough to see if it's tasty. Oh and do some science while you're there, may as well pretend we're doing this for the good of Kerbalkind and all that.

	notes = In assembly, use the tag 'Mariner' to find components fitting for this mission.
    completedMessage = That's it, all science was returned in good order. Sadly, we're still in the dark about the edibility of @targetBody.
