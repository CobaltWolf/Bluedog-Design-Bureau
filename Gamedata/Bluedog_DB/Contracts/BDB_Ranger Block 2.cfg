    genericTitle = Achieve a rough landing.
    genericDescription = Achieve and survive a rough landing with a probe.
	
	title = Achieve a rough landing on @targetBody.
	description = You'll be glad to know that, after our recent 'lithobraking' debacle, Bob has been reassigned to very important duties at the pinnacle of our space program, as a strictly voluntary development test du.. pilot. We can all agree that the attempt was very spectacular - we even saved the tapes for our annual KSC blooper reel! However, it wasn't quite what we had envisioned. Basically, we want you to try again, except try a little harder this time. Or less hard, depending on your perspective...&br;&br;We think we may have just the thing to help you actually succeed, too: it's called a 'rough lander probe'. Don't tell anyone, but it's really just a painted-over tennis ball with a micro transmitter put inside. The idea is simple, really: since we expect it to be too hard for you to land the whole probe softly, you can just drop the rough lander probe to the surface once you're near. But you're still going to have to do some extra braking beforehand, it's still got to slow down quite a bit. Once on the surface, be sure to send back data from the impact. And we still want you to gather science on the way there too, this ain't a charity.
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Launch a Burke Block 2 probe to @targetBody and perform experiments in low space, before dropping the rough lander to a survivable impact and seismic science transmission.</color>
	notes = In assembly, use the tag 'Ranger' to find components fitting for this mission.
    completedMessage = You actually did it! Personally, I had money riding on @targetBody eating that probe for breakfast. Or whatever meal's the fashion out there these days.
