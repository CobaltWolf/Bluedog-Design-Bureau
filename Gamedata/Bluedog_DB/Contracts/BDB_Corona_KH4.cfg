    genericTitle = Perform photo reconnaissance.
    genericDescription = Perform photo reconnaissance of the specified areas.
	
	title = Perform photo reconnaissance from a polar orbit of @targetBody.
	description = Welcome back, Kommander. We have just intercepted an encrypted transmission suggesting that our rivals, those Kommy Krussians, may have set up suspicious new activities in several areas on @targetBody. Our Kovert Ops units are out of reach, so we want you to get up there and take pictures of the suspected areas. If there's any Krussian activity there, we will know. Oh and you will have to return the film canister back to base, we haven't figured out how to turn black and white into 1's and 0's yet.
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Launch a Cerveza KH-4 recon satellite into space around @targetBody and perform photo recon of the specified areas.</color>
	notes = In assembly, use the tag 'KH4' to find components fitting for this mission.
    completedMessage = Either those Krussians have developed excellent camouflage, or we really are just looking at a Kerbal-shaped rock formation. We'll get them next time!
