    name = BDB_SolarStudy
    group = BluedogDB
    genericTitle = Perform a Kerbolar study
    genericDescription = Perform a Kerbolar study from orbit of a planet or moon.
	
	title = Perform a Kerbolar study from orbit of @targetBody.
	description = Kerbol has been a steady source of beautiful light and warmth for as long as Kerbalkind can remember. Our top scientists have however developed a sneaking suspicion that there's more to it. So we need someone to perform a further study of Kerbol from orbit of @targetBody. That someone is you.&br;&br;While we're pretty sure all this talk of solar radiation and other strange mumblings we overheard the eggheads saying are perfectly harmless, there's no need to expose Kerbals for these experiments. But we won't stop you if you want to do so anyway! Just sign this waiver first.
