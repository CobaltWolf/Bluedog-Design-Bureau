{
    name = BDB_Gambit
    group = BluedogDB
    genericTitle = Perform photo surveillance.
    genericDescription = Perform photo surveillance of the specified areas.
	
	title = Perform photo surveillance from a polar orbit of @targetBody.
	description = Welcome back, Kommander. Despite our previous reconnaissance finding mostly strange rock formations, we believe the Krussians are once again at it on @targetBody. We want you to take a more modern "Gamble" surveillance satellite into orbit of @targetBody, scan the specified areas with a more advanced camera system and return the film back to base. This message is top secret and will self-destruct in 3...2..1.... Wait, did Jeb get away with the explosives again?
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Launch a Gamble surveillance satellite into space around @targetBody and perform photo surveillance of the specified areas.</color>
	notes = In assembly, use the tag 'KH8' to find components fitting for this mission.
    completedMessage = Still no sign of those Krussians! You're beginning to suspect High Kommand simply wanted new wallpapers.
