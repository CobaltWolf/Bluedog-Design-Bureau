    genericTitle = Perform a magnetic field study.
    genericDescription = Perform a magnetic field study from varying orbits.
	
	title = Perform a magnetic field study of @targetBody.
	description = Our previous studies into the geophysical properties of @targetBody have shown us the presence of an ominously named phenomenon called the magnetosphere. Wernher initially jumped around the lab with joy, screaming that he'd been right all along and there really is a Dyson sphere after all. He quickly became disappointed however, when we told him it was just a giant magnetic field.&br;&br; After overcoming his disappointment and having stuffed himself with comfort food (we hear his favorite is peanut-butter-jelly donuts with a guacamole side), Wernher concluded the magnetosphere is still very much worth studying. He came up with the following mission to maximize our understanding of this magnet stuff. Go do science!
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Launch a MIP research satellite into the specified orbits around @targetBody and perform the requested experiments.</color>
	notes = In assembly, use the tag 'MIP' to find components fitting for this mission.
    completedMessage = Wernher is still disappointed, but at least we are now sure that @targetBody is a giant magnet that may or may not be edible.
