    genericTitle = Perform a weather study.
    genericDescription = Perform a weather study from orbit of a planet.
	
	title = Perform a weather study from orbit of @targetBody.
	description = You've heard of weather, right? It's that stuff that makes moisture appear out of thin air. Now, one of our slightly more eccentric colleagues was looking up at the sky recently and he's saying there some bad weather about that may interfere with our plans. So, we decided that you should do what we do best: launch a rocket up and around to go check it out. Your mission is to determine the weather out at the indicated areas and whether or not we can weather it.
	
    synopsis = <color=yellow>Launch a Aeolus weather satellite into space around @targetBody and perform the requested experiments.</color>
	notes = In assembly, use the tag 'Nimbus' to find components fitting for this mission.
    completedMessage = Thanks to the extensive weather data you gathered, we can now predict with absolute certainty that the weather is going to be completely unpredictable.
