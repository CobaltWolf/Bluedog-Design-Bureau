	RESULTS
	{
		default = Collected high resolution images of the Sun.
		default = These photos almost suggest there's a... a hole in the corona of the Sun.
		default = An enormous prominence stretches out of the Sun. Our home is but a speck compared to it.
		default = Collected H-alpha measurements of the Sun's chromosphere during a solar flare.
		GillyInSpace = Monitoring the Sun for flare activity... seems like we're good, for now.
		MohoInSpace = Monitoring the Sun for flare activity. Even a small one directed at the spacecraft could be catastrophic if it catches us unaware, after all.
		SunInSpaceLow = Somehow you doubt that the Telescope Mount was designed to get this close...
		KerbinFlyingHigh = It seems that the Telescope Mount is in the atmosphere at the moment. Is it deorbiting early? Maybe that has to do with the sun?
		DunaInSpace = Monitoring the Sun for flare activity... seems like we're good, for now.
		JoolInSpace = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Jool and its moons, revealing lovely details of swirling clouds on Jool.
		JoolInSpace = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Jool's moons. Laythe seems to have a weather system not to dissimilar to that of Kerbin!
		JoolInSpace = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Jool's moons. There seems to be a corona around Vall... wait, no, that's just water vapor plumes.
		JoolInSpace = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Jool's moons. The telescope maps the craters of Tylo.
		LaytheInSpaceLow = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Jool. Visual observations recover lovely pictures of the swirling cloud bands of the green planet.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Laythe. Laythe's cloud patterns are observed. The atmospheric dynamics are quite similar to those on Kerbin.
		VallInSpace = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Jool. Visual observations recover lovely pictures of the swirling cloud bands of the green planet.
		TyloInSpace = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Jool. Visual observations recover lovely pictures of the swirling cloud bands of the green planet.
		BopInSpace = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Jool. Visual observations recover lovely pictures of the swirling cloud bands of the green planet.
		PolInSpace = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Jool. Visual observations recover lovely pictures of the swirling cloud bands of the green planet.
		EelooInSpaceLow = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. Unfortunately, the telescope is too close to Eeloo to get good pictures of the planet.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = Solar photography is impractical at this distance. With the filters removed, the telescope can be turned to study Eeloo. Detailed maps of Eeloo's terrain can be reconstructed.
