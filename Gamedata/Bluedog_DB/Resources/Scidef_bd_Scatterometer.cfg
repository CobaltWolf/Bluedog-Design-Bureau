	RESULTS
	{

	default = You measure local surface wind speeds from orbit.
	default = The scatterometer measures reflected microwave energy to determine near-surface wind speeds.
	default = The scatterometer collects data to determine surface-level the direction and speed of the wind.

	KerbinInSpace = Radar scatterometry data is collected from over Kerbin.
	KerbinInSpaceLow = The scatterometer collects data from low Kerbin orbit.
	KerbinInSpaceLow = The surface level wind speed data seems to differ drastically in intensity from region in region.
	KerbinInSpaceLowWater = The scatterometer picks up data from a tropical storm, high levels of wind indicate a hurricaine is potentially forming.
	KerbinInSpaceLowWater = Data appears to suggest this area of the sea is calm for the moment, with wind speeds lower than average.
	KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The flatter regions of Kerbin's grasslands allow for less resistance against the wind, leading to higher wind speeds and greater chances of tornado formation.
	KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = Wind speeds fluctuate greatly in Kerbin's deserts; the wind can go from being a calming breeze to a violent sand storm very quickly and unexpectedly.
	KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = Tall and large natural structures like mountains are quite effective at blocking wind, therefore slowing wind down. On the other hand, wind speed is greater at higher altitudes and mountains can also create a wind tunnel effect, raising the wind speed.
	KerbinInSpaceLowShores = The scatterometer detects a calm, oceanly breeze from Kerbin's shores. Maybe it's time to go on vacation soon. 
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = The scatterometer collects data from high Kerbin orbit.
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = The scatterometer instrument allows for surface wind data to be collected on a massive scale.
	KerbinInSpaceHighWater = The wind speed over the waters of Kerbin appears to be about twice the wind speed on the land!

	EveInSpace = Radar scatterometry data is collected from over Eve.
	EveInSpaceLow = The scatterometer collects data from low Eve orbit.
	EveInSpaceLow = Due to Eve's intense and extreme nature, one might expect fast, turbulent, and deadly winds. But scatterometer data shows that surface-level wind speed is far less than Kerbin's. This is because the denser atmosphere lowers the wind speed.
	EveInSpaceLowExplodiumSea = Just like on Kerbin, wind speeds over Eve's oceans seem to be greater than the wind speeds on land.
	EveInSpaceLowCraterLake = Normally the wind speed over the oceans and lakes of a body will be stronger. But in this region the wind speed seems to be abnormally low. This is likely because the crater's walls are sheltering the lake from some of the wind.

	EveInSpaceLowPeaks = The scatterometer measures extremely strong winds over Eve's peaks! Be careful what you land here!

	DunaInSpaceLow = The scatterometer collects data from low Duna orbit.

	LaytheInSpaceLow = Scatterometry data reveals Laythe seems to be perpetually burdened by strong winds.
	LaytheInSpaceLowTheSagenSea = Scatterometry data reveals that tsunamis, hurricaines, and tropical storms seem to be common on Laythe.
	LaytheInSpaceLowCraterBay = Wind speeds seem to be much lower over Crater Lake.
	LaytheInSpaceHigh = The scatterometer collects data from high Laythe orbit.
	LaytheInSpaceHigh = Surface-level wind speeds seem to be suprisingly higher than Kerbin's! This suggests Laythe's surface pressure is lower than Kerbin's.
