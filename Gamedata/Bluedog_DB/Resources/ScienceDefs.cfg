	KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The astronauts being who they are begin fighting to see who is going to be in the center of the group photo.  Unsurprisingly, Jeb won.
	KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The crawlerway is a long slab of concrete but your photo might one day make it into an abstract art gallery.
	KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = It's a damned flag pole.  And there's not flag flying today.  So you took a picture of a long metal stick.

	KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = It's a tank full of jet fuel.  At least the pilots say that it is but secretly you believe this to be the storage vat for Jeb's supply of beer.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = If Jeb's beer isn't in the round tank, it has to be here.  Unfortunately, if you're wrong when you open the tank it will likely mean your death.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = On the hunt for Jeb's beer storage tank you have taken photos of the water tower.  Unfortunately Arnold the Giant Kerbal told you to come down halfway in your climb to the top to prove your theory.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = As you start taking photos of the large comm dishes in the area, you see a black government car pull up but no one gets out.  They're just sitting there.  Watching you.

	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = As you hurry around the corner to the south dish you run head on into Arnold followed by one of the government suits.  There's a blinding flash of light and when you wake up no one is there, you can't remember anything and your camera is empty of all photos.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You were able to snap a shot of the hub but at the distance you took the picture it looks like nothing more than a mobile home with three large satellite dishes in the front yard.
	KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The VAB is so tall you had to lay on the ground to fit it in the frame.  You've won a $50 prize for an abstract photo contest with this image.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = After winning your $50 photo contest with your other VAB shot you decided to try the same thing again.  Unfortunately this is old hat now and everyone is taking pictures by lying on the ground now.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = The memorial is a somber reminder of all the brave souls who came before and gave their lives in service to the greater good.  That's what the researchers and engineers who blew them up say anyway.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The hunt for Jeb's beer storage continues...
	KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex = The engineers chose this location for their group photo.  It was lovely and all 219 asked you to make a copy of it for them.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The ground crew chose this location for their ground photo.  You are nearly positive they were using this as a pretense to protect Jeb's beer storage.
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = It really was much easier to fit the entire KSC in an image from the air.  Climbing to the top of the VAB just didn't cut it but you still got a resonably good shot of the grounds.

	MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = Imaging data from this "smaller" impact has proven just as important as that from the large craters around the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = A favorite landing site of many, photographic evidence helps to reveal this crater to be one of the oldest on the surface.
	MunSrfLandedHighland = The highland regions of the Mun appear to have been formed during a period where the surface of the Mun was still geologically active.
	MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = These small impact craters are younger and therefore photographic data helps to answer many questions about the different impact eras of the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedMidlands = As with other regions on the Mun, imaging data shows the midlands appear to have been thrust upward during a geologically active period on the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = As with other smaller impact regions, the midland craters are shown through photo evidence to be younger than other impact areas around the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = This gigantic basin appears to be the result of molten rock flowing over the surface in the distant past.  Imaging data from the surface does not help to answer what may have caused it to flow in the first place.

			MunInSpaceLowPoles = Not much different from the rest of the mun, except that some parts of the polar region receive sunlight almost year round
			MunInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = Lower areas near the poles might contain water ice where craters are kept in eternal darkness. Or not. Its not like you can see anything in them.
			MunInSpaceLow = Closer to the moon now, you see that craters have ravaged the surface. Even the plains are unforgiven, which makes you infer that time has taken its toll on the Mun's surface...
				MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun appears to be very cratered while the lowlands sit pristinely below all of the mountains.

	MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = In pictures, the gently rolling lowlands almost appear to be the surface of roiling sea of melted mint ice cream.
	MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The highland regions of Minmus are difficult to separate from other regions in photos requiring altitude measurements to know when the transition occured.
	MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = The highly irregular slopes of Minmus have often been observed in photos as appearing to be "scoops of ice cream" on the surface.
	MinmusSrfLandedFlats = It's flat, punctuated by a sharp increase in altitude around the perimeter.  Images help to show just how nearly perfectly level this region really is.
	MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = One of the largest flatland regions on the surface, in pictures the great flats appear to be a perfectly smooth frozen lake of green liquid.
	MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The largest continuous flat region on the surface, the Greater Flats may once have been a sea of liquid on the surface that has long since frozen.  Images from this region reveal just how large it is as certain areas actually go to the horizon with no change in appearance.
	MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = These smaller flat regions appear regularly around the moon and likely were small lakes at some point.  Photos taken in this region are surrounded on all sides by large hills forming the slopes and higher regions of Minmus.
	MinmusSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the poles is helping to answer questions whether Minmus was once a comet that was captured by Kerbin or whether some alien race simply spilled their giant bowl of mint ice cream.  Researchers are inclined to believe the former but the general public is another question...
	MinmusSrfLanded = The minty colored surface amazes you as you stare above and below where you have taken this photo.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus reveals varying terrain. High plateaus stretch for kilometres and the plains below them stretch even farther.
				MinmusInSpaceHigh = From so far away, Minmus resembles a small scoop of mint ice cream...

	MohoSrfLandedHighlands = Surface photos in the highlands reveal Moho had to have been volcanically active at some point in the past.  Lava fields and other geologic formations of this region could only have been formed by such activity.
	MohoSrfLandedMidlands = Photos taken within the midland region lend further support to the idea that much of Moho's surface has been shaped by volcanism.
	MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters = These various small craters are numerous on the surface of Moho and photos within them are helping to answer some of the questions about it's geologically active periods.
	MohoSrfLandedNorthPole = Unlike it's polar opposite, the north pole of Moho is extremely irregular and cratered with vastly different high and low points.  Photographic evidence clearly shows the highly varied surface.
	MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole = At one time, stories were rampant that an enormous hole existed in this region which penetrated deep into the planet.  Photographic evidence has shown this not to be true.  The public outcry of a government cover-up has reached epic proportions.
	MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge = A long, narrow ridge spanning a good deal of this sinkhole region shows up starkly in photographs.  It is believed to be the product of volcanism but more study will be needed.
	MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands = The lowland regions of the planet are home to numerous small craters and dune like rock formations shown repeatedly in pictures of these regions.

	MohoSrfLandedCanyon = The deep canyons and sharp walls are further evidence of geologic activity on the planet as no liquid could have eroded this region.  Photo evidence helps to support the idea this region was created through volcanic activity.
	MohoSrfLandedSouthPole = The south pole of Moho is similar in appearance and formation as the various lowlands.  Nearly uniform in altitude with very few craters or differences in high and low points, image data reveals this to be as different from the north pole in appearance as it is in location.
	MohoSrfLanded = After your descent, you see the distinct features of the planet. Craters are visible as far as the eye can see.
		MohoInSpaceLow = Craters become clear on Moho's surface. With immense detail, the craters have craters. This reminds you that you are too close for comfort...
			MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho floats far away, punished with craters. You can almost see the heat of the home star, Kerbol...

	EveSrfLanded = The purple sand of this dense planet stretches across the surface. You get hungry and wonder if this sand is toxic if eaten...
	EveSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the surface shows just how uniform and regular the poles of Eve really are.  Slight variations in altitude are revealed but very little in the way of extensive surface features exist to break up the nearly flat regions.
	EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = A vast, low lying sea of liquid hydrocarbons shows vividly purple in image data.  It is quite obvious that the coloration caused by the hydrocarbons in both the sea and atmosphere lends Eve its distinct appearance.
	EveSrfLandedLowlands = Very low altitudes and gentle, rolling landscapes make up most of the lowlands creating a very purple picturesque image.
	EveSrfLandedMidlands = Similar to the lowlands, the midlands differ primarily in their altitude.  The same rolling landscape with very little in the way of features is captured clearly in image data.
	EveSrfLandedHighlands = While areas leading to the peaks have broken and irregular landscapes, most of the highlands are revealed in photographs to be extremely similar to the other land regions of the planet.
	EveSrfLandedPeaks = An amazing feature of Eve is the sharp, distinct peaks jutting thousands of meters above the surface with sheer cliffs and canyons nestled between them.  The image data from this area has proven to be the public's favorite for it's vistas and distinct appearance.
	EveSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The narrow bands of impact ejecta are proving fascinating to scientists as they struggle to understand the image data which appears to show numerous regions around the planet where bodies have survived the atmosphere to impact the surface.
		EveFlyingLow = With numerous low areas and vast, unbroken regions, image data collected in flight is proving most valuable to scientists.
			EveFlyingHigh = With the few surface details obliterated due to altitude, photographic data from hgh altitudes is mostly useful to help refine mapping data for the planet.

					EveInSpaceHigh = Eve shimmers with its purple hue down below you. Or was it up? You can't remember...



	GillySrfLanded = The photo shows a wide variety of mountains. There is really nothing else here.
	GillySrfLandedLowlands = The highly irregular surface of this captured asteroid shows up distinctly in image data.  Even the lowlands aren't exactly low in most places and finding level ground is nearly impossible even when looking over photographs.
	GillySrfLandedMidlands = The midlands, like the other regions of this barren rock, is as irregular as it is odd looking.  The beige color of the surface shows up in sharp cut relief against the walls of valleys and mountains.
	GillySrfLandedHighlands = The highland regions are more erratic in shape, altitude and slope than any other region of this small body causing long shadows and prominent peaks to be cast in stark relief of the image data.
		GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly, a beige captured asteroid reveals very extreme terrain. A blur in the photo shows its fast rotation.
			GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly barely resembles a dot in the photo.

	DunaSrfLanded = The red dirt below you appears to be coarse and dry. Wait, did that rock move between photos?
	DunaSrfLandedHighlands = Photographs show the rolling hills of the Duna highlands and the irregular surface indicating the presence of geologic activity in the far distant past.
	DunaSrfLandedCraters = Impact craters on the surface of Duna are easily seen in imaging data due to the very low levels of erosion on the surface.
	DunaSrfLandedPoles = The ice covered poles of Duna shine brightly in pictures and details of the broken glacier fields become readily apparent.
	DunaSrfLandedLowlands = The lowlands, like many other areas on Duna, are varied in altitude and surface features.  Imaging data reveals the long term presence of liquid on the surface contributed to erosion in combination with geologic activity on the surface.
	DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The midlands lack a defining boundary between regions making it difficult to determine where the highlands end, the midlands begin and the lowland take over.  Further evidence within the imaging data of past geological activity will leave researchers in a tizzy for several years you're sure.
		DunaFlyingLow = Surface details showing erosion, weather activity and long term geologic activity is easily seen in photographs from low altitude.
			DunaFlyingHigh = The details of the surface have faded but large scale features revealing long term changes to the surface is unmistakable in photos from high altitude.

	IkeSrfLanded = The pictures show rocky evidence of recent tectonic activity.
	IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The polar lowlands are one of the few fairly level regions of Ike's surface.  It is unknown whether this is formerly an impact crater or simply a surface feature and photos do not help to determine the answer to this nagging question.
	IkeSrfLandedMidlands = Like the majority of the Ike, the midlands are a broken landscape marked by vastly different altitudes, steep slopes and cliffs and a distinct lack of craters all of which is revealed in imaging data.
	IkeSrfLandedLowlands = The lowlands of Ike are deep depressions in the surface at much lower altitudes than most of the moon.  Imaging data shows the transition regions of these areas to be extremely steep and rising quickly to mountain ridges and the higher altitudes of the midlands.
	IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = The tallest peak on the surface can be found along the Eastern Mountain Ridge and proves to be one of the best places to take wife field images of the surface.
	IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = The Western Mountain Ridge, although lower in over all altitude, spans almost the entire surface of Ike from pole to pole and it's many plateuas would be very picturesque if it you could actually see anything.  Unfortunately, this region faces away from Duna at all times leaving it largely in darkness due to the low levels of sunlight.
	IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = The Central Mountain Range, on average, is even lower in altitude than the western ridge but it faces Duna at all times.  This creates opporunities for stunning views across the surface of Ike and out into space towards Duna which you take advantage of with your camera.
	IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = Like the Western Mountain Ridge, the Easter Range is located on the side of Ike facing away from Duna leaving it in shadowy darkness most of the time.  Your images do littel to illuminate this area.
	IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The South Pole of Ike is a colossal plateau towering over 9000m in most places.  It also has a fairly level average surface slope making it an excellent place for landing and research.  However, due to Ike's axial tilt, it faces away from Duna and mostly lies in shadow except in the most westerly areas of the region making your image data difficult to interpret.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike shows its weathered terrain quite clearly. Mountain ranges dominate the surface while the plains come in dark, large patches.
			IkeInSpaceHigh = The rock we call Ike is massive. It appears to be quite dense from so far away. It also appears to have very rugged terrain, more so than your own moon.

	DresSrfLandedPoles = The surface of Dres is well known for it's lack of cratering and the poles are no exception.  Photo evidence confirms this.
	DresSrfLandedHighlands = The highlands of Dres are not exactly high in comparison to similar regions of the solar system so named.  They are small in area and are largely devoid of craters in photos.  Odd considering they are technically supposed to be the tallest and most exposed regions of the planet.
	DresSrfLandedMidlands = Image data shows the midland regions of Dres to be an irregular, broken landscape showing no regular boundaries between regions and frequent changes in altitude.
	DresSrfLandedLowlands = The lowland regions of Dres are vast and photo evidence shows that a majority of the few impact craters on the surface occur in these areas.
	DresSrfLandedRidges = The ridges of Dres are not tall despite the name.  Pictures of these zones show them to be steeply sloped and higly irregular.
	DresSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The impact regions of Dres are surrounded by tiny regions of ejecta blankets where debris from the collision spreds out from the impact site.  Photo evidence clearly shows how small these locales really are.
	DresSrfLandedImpactCraters = Like other bodies lacking an atmosphere, Dres has impact craters although very few of them in comparion.  Your image data of suspected impact zones may help to identify others.
	DresSrfLandedCanyons = The canyons of Dres have some of the steepest and tallest walls you have seen yet.  Photos of the region are difficult to analyze because these zones are in nearly constant shadow from the cliff sides.
		DresInSpaceLow = Closer to Dres now, you begin to collect evidence that she is not a planet, but she is a dwarf planet which once was a gargantuan rogue asteroid.
			DresInSpaceHigh = Dres reminds you of the Mun. It holds quite uneven terrain with a grey hue.

					LaytheInSpaceHigh = From here, Laythe looks like a pale blue marble.


	VallSrfLanded = There are no even landing spots on this moon. Perhaps it is a consequence of cryo-volcanism or the tidal forces exerted on Vall.
	VallSrfLandedPoles = The poles look less hostile than some other parts of Vall. Still not a pole you would want to meet in an alley.
	VallSrfLandedMidlands = The camera is taking a moment to enjoy the view

	TyloSrfLandedMajorCrater = It looks a bit like a big soup bowl.
	TyloSrfLandedMajorCrater = The crater is deep and cold... Pretty much like all craters.
	TyloSrfLandedMinorCraters = You know what they say: Even the smallest crater can become a big crater at some point.

	TyloSrfLandedMidlands = The light is playing tricks with the hills and valleys, causing a dramatic scene.
	TyloSrfLandedLowlands = Dusty and dark, somehow this reminds you to clean up the attic this weekend.
	TyloSrfLandedMara = Sliding up and down the edge of the crater could be fun.

	{
		default = Collected an observation of the weather below the spacecraft.
		default = The clouds below make a pretty pattern... Look, that one looks like Jeb!
		default = Nothing to see here. Maybe you'll spot some clouds later in your orbit?
		default = The whole image is white! Did the camera fail? Nope, it's just a lot of clouds.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The image you get provides a "big picture" of the weather across the planet. The Meterology team will love this!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = This image of the large-scale weather patterns allows scientists to see how different weather fronts interact. This will help us refine our weather models.
		kerbinInSpaceHigh = The picture you get is quite pretty. We should hang it on the wall in the snack room!
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = It's hard to pick out the clouds against the ice caps below them. The scientists will need to think this over some more...
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = So that's what a blizzard looks like from space.
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = Looks like another snowstorm rolling down towards the Woomerang Launch Site. We should tell them that's coming.
		KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = There's not much going on aside from cloud cover... Oh. That's ice, not clouds. Dang it!
		KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = That's a nasty snowstorm down there... Glad we're near the equator!

		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = Hey, where'd the clouds that were there last orbit go?
		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = Wait, where did that storm come from? And is that snow?
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The rugged terrain causes storms to form along the mountains.
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The large amount of cloud cover makes it hard to see what's going on down below.
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The clear skies make you think of your last kamping trip to the mountains.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The spring thunderstorms can get quite sizeable. We should warn people in the path of them.

		JoolInSpaceLow = From just above the atmosphere of Jool, you don't get as much of a "big picture" view. The details, however... aren't much better. Just lots and lots of clouds.
		JoolInSpaceLow = Now that you're closer to Jool, the sheer scale of the storms you saw earlier becomes evident. Some of these hurricanes are big enough to span a fair portion of Kerbin's surface!
		JoolInSpaceLow = You don't see much deeper than the first cloud layer, but what you do see will help scientists better understand what's going on inside Jool.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = From high above Laythe, you notice that there's no cyclonic storms. The meterology team's going to be scratching their heads over this one.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = There's not any significant storm activity... mostly scattered thunderstorms around the islands near the local "afternoon".
		LaytheInSpaceLowPoles = There's not much weather here... only the occasional rainstorm turned snowstorm.
		LaytheInSpaceLowShores = The lack of hurricane activity makes this an attractive location for a resort. Maybe someone will open one here someday?
		LaytheInSpaceLowShores = The low gravity and steady winds make for large surf. Perhaps the first crew to visit should pack a surfboard...
		LaytheInSpaceLowDunes = The steady winds of Laythe, combined with the low gravity, make for some massive sand dunes.
		LaytheInSpaceLowCrescentBay = The surf here is much lower than elsewhere on the shores. Perhaps this would make for a good swimming hole.
		LaytheInSpaceLowCraterBay = The splash rim of the crater seems to help deflect the worst of the weather around the bay. This may be an ideal spot to operate a seaplane out of...
		LaytheInSpaceLowPeaks = The peaks of Laythe are covered in snow and whipped by winds. Not a pleasant place to be, for sure.
		LaytheInSpaceLowShallows = Most of the thunderstorm activity on Laythe seems to originate from the shallows, where the water is warmest.
		LaytheInSpaceLowCraterIsland = The island is well protected from most of the weather by the crater rim.
		LaytheInSpaceLowTheSagenSea = Not a single hurricane in sight. Why might that be?
		LaytheInSpaceLowTheSagenSea = The large expanse of open, deep water seems to kill off any storms that cross over it.
		LaytheInSpaceLowDegrasseSea = The deep, open water doesn't seem to support storm formation well.
