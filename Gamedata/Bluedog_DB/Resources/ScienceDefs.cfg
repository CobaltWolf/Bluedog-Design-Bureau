		default = There might have been an impact recently, but you weren't paying attention.
		default = The hole beside the impactor COULD be a test result but you're too busy stopping explosive decompression to find out.
		
		KerbinInSpaceLow = IMPACT... looks like everything is still in one piece, thankfully. It seems that spacecraft can survive debris impacts, but we should make sure our vessels are shielded.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = When the mun hits your eye like a big pizza pie...that's an impact!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The detector has logged fewer impacts since attaining a higher orbit.
				
		MunInSpaceLow = It appears the Mun had a smaller moon orbiting it - oh. It's gone.

		DresInSpaceLow = You stopped counting the number of impacts soon after you arrived at Dres.
		DresInSpaceHigh = If Dres isn't trying to kill you why are there 42 hull patches and no hits on the detector?
		
		JoolInSpaceLow = It seems that the orbits of any small debris decayed into the gas giant long ago- PING!
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Apparently even the particles are bigger at Jool...

		BopInSpaceHigh = Mission Control, Flight.  Did we just collode with Bop?
		
		PolInSpaceLow = Judging from the impact, we may have impacted something crystalline in nature. 
		PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, polled politely, properly produced predicted principles of impacts.

		EelooInSpaceHigh = We came, we saw, we got hit by more rocks.
		
		AsteroidInSpaceLow = Pieces of the asteroid seem to have broken off from the activity around it...
		AsteroidInSpaceHigh = WAIT!  No one said anything about rocks around the rock.

	LaytheInSpaceHigh = The readings show a slight magnetosphere..

	VallInSpaceHigh = These readings show no promising results... 
	VallInSpaceLow = You can now conclude that Vall may have never had a magnetosphere... 
	TyloInSpaceHigh = Ion trap readings show good evidence of a strong magnetosphere around Tylo. 
	TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo does indeed have a strong and tough magnetosphere according to the results. 
	BopInSpaceHigh = These readings show no promising results...

	 KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The VAB is rumored to be the home of the Kraken but it summers at the SPH.  The spectrometer doesn't work here either.
	 KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = Rumors abound that money is paid for results in this locaiton.  You get the most precise readings of BS yet.

	 IkeSrfLanded = Molecular carbon and oxygen are still heavily detected but surface results provide strong readings geologists will be able to use to determine Ike's chemical makeup.
	
	 DresInSpaceLow = Spectroscopic results indicate a large presence of silicate and carbonate dust around the planet possibly coming from the local asteroid ring.

	 JoolInSpaceLow = Strong detection lines of hydrogen and helium are present along with a number of H/He isotopes.  A fair amount of ammonia was expected but was not found.
	 LaytheInSpaceLow = Water, oxygen and various salts were expected.  The presence of trace amounts of chlorine was not.
	 LaytheSrfLanded = Surface scans confirm the waters of Laythe to contain high levels of salinity.  Atmospheric results also show ozone and trace amounts of chlorine making it completely unbreathable.
	 VallInSpaceLow = Water and nitrogen are both showing up strongly in the scanners results from orbit.

	TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo is humongous. It is a massive rock the size of Kerbin. The speckles turn out to be tens of thousands of craters. Tylo reveals a highly beaten surface like the Mun. The scientists in the lab infer that Tylo does indeed have trace amounts of cobalt.
