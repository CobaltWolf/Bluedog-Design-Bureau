	VallInSpaceHigh = Vall stands valiant, far away, as a pale blue dot. 
	VallInSpaceLow = Vall holds blue plains and lighter blue mountains ranges that snake around the planet's surface in every which way. 
	VallSrfLanded = There are no even landing spots on this moon. Perhaps it is a consequence of cryo-volcanism or the tidal forces exerted on Vall. 
	TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo, from so far out, appears to be speckled. Why didn't we name it Spot? 
	TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo is humongous. It is a massive rock the size of Kerbin. The speckles turn out to be tens of thousands of craters. Tylo reveals a highly beaten surface like the Mun. The scientists in the lab infer that Tylo does indeed have trace amounts of cobalt.

	AsteroidSrfLandedCType = Only a very faint magnetic signal is detected from this asteroid, suggesting only low concentrations of iron and nickel.
	AsteroidSrfLandedEType = A relatively strong magnetic field is detected from the surface of this asteroid, an indication that it is primarily metallic in composition.
	AsteroidSrfLandedMType = This asteroid is generating a significant magnetic field, suggesting that it is a metallic, M-type object, rich in iron and nickel compounds.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = You observe the radiation levels.

		KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = Radiation levels are higher than normal. You suspect someone has been testing a nuclear powered rocket system again.
		KerbinSrfLandedRunway = Radiation levels are the same as it always does around here.
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = Radiation levels are slightly higher than normal.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Radiation levels are normal, but the water is pretty.
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = Radiation levels are normal, but the water is pretty.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Radiation levels are normal.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Radiation levels are normal. Sand is getting in the detector.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = Radiation levels are normal, and you suddenly want to go to the beach!
		KerbinSrfLandedKSC = Radiation levels are normal.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You have encountered some elevated radiation levels.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You have encountered an unusual radiation zone around Kerbin. Radiation levels are much Higher than they should be, Van Kerbin was right!
		KerbinFlyingHighMountains = The mountains are slightly radioactive.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = The mountains give off higher than normal amounts of radiation. You wonder what is buried in the rock?
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = A closer scan of the mountains reveals veins of highly energetic radioactive ore.  Perhaps a future space fuel?
		KerbinFlyingHighBadlands = The Badlands are causing higher than normal levels of radiation?
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = The Badlands are causing an unusual radiation spike.
		KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Danger! Danger! Radiation levels have exceeded safe limits!
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = "It is hot here!" What an odd thing for a scientific instrument to say?
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Radiation levels are higher than normal.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = You have encountered some elevated radiation levels.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You have encountered an unusual radiation zone around Kerbin. Radiation levels are much Higher than they should be, Van Kerbin was right!		
		
		MohoInSpaceHigh = Radiation levels are off the scales! You better not stay here long...
		MohoInSpaceHigh = The detector is going nuts. It may start melting soon.
		MohoInSpaceLow = The detector has melted...
		MohoSrfLanded = You stare at the blob of yellow Goo that use to be your Geiger counter and wonder how the rest of the ship survived.

		MunInSpace  = Radiation levels are slightly higher than normal.
		MunSrfLanded = Radiation levels have returned to zero. 
		MunSrfLanded = You look at the Detector, your thoughts drift as you wait for a response. Then you turn off the detector and contemplate your existence in the universe.
		MunSrfLanded = This thing sure is yellow! The box, I mean... 
		MunFlyingLow = Radiation levels are dropping.
		MunFlyingHigh = Radiation levels are slightly higher than normal but falling.
		MinmusSrfLanded = The box gives out a single click and then just sits there.
		MinmusInSpace = Radiation levels are dropping.

		EveInSpace = Radiation levels are high here.
		EveInSpace = You detect much Higher than normal radiation.
		EveFlyingHigh = Radiation levels are dropping.
		EveFlyingLow = Radiation levels are almost zero.
		EveSrfLanded = Even though your relatively close to the sun your detecting no radiation on the surface. The thick atmosphere must be blocking the radiation.
		DunaInSpace = Radiation levels are slightly higher than normal.
		DunaSrfLanded = Radiation levels are slightly lower than normal.
		
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Radiation levels are higher than normal.
		JoolInSpaceLow = You have encountered a radiation zone around the planet. Radiation levels are much Higher than normal.
		
		BopInSpace = Radiation levels are slightly higher than normal.

		PolInSpace = Radiation levels are slightly higher than normal.

		EeLooInSpace = Radiation levels are very low here.
		EeLooInSpace = Readings are 0. You check to make sure the instrument is on. Yep, its on, just nothing here...
		
		SunInSpaceHigh = Going further from the Sun your detecting increasing levels of radiation. Maybe some sort of cosmic source?
		SunInSpaceLow = Your detecting higher levels of radiation near the Sun. Maybe you should examine this more closely?
		SunFlyingHigh = The detector has melted, and the rest of the ship is not far behind...
