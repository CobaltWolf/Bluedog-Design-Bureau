		default = All's quiet. Looks like nothing's going t- PING!
		default = There might have been an impact recently, but you weren't paying attention.
		default = The hole beside the impactor COULD be a test result but you're too busy stopping explosive decompression to find out.
		
		KerbinInSpaceLow = IMPACT... looks like everything is still in one piece, thankfully. It seems that spacecraft can survive debris impacts, but we should make sure our vessels are shielded.
		KerbinInSpaceLow = When the mun hits your eye like a big pizza pie...that's an impact!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The detector has logged fewer impacts since attaining a higher orbit.
				
		MunInSpaceLow = It appears the Mun had a smaller moon orbiting it - oh. It's gone. 
		MunInSpaceHigh = So those tiny pinging sounds?  Yeah, that was your science result announcing its arrival.
		
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Based on recent impacts, you believe Minmus is challenging you to a snowball fight.
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = All these tiny paticles kind of reminds you of sprinkles on an ice cream cone...

		IkeInSpaceLow = You ask Wehrner if that was the famous magic boulder... Or at least a piece of it.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Well Ike is here but I don't see Mike anywhere.  What's that splatter on the detector?
		
		DresInSpaceLow = You stopped counting the number of impacts soon after you arrived at Dres.
		DresInSpaceHigh = If Dres isn't trying to kill you why are there 42 hull patches and no hits on the detector?
		
		JoolInSpaceLow = It seems that the orbits of any small debris decayed into the gas giant long ago- PING!
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Apparently even the particles are bigger at Jool...
		
		LaytheInSpaceLow = That impact seemed decidedly... moist.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = It appears that Laythe has offcially sneezed on your detector.  Congratulations on being to first to discover space boogers!
		
		VallInSpaceLow = Yet another impact... so what?
		VallInSpaceHigh = In sector 637-K the particles are fine and grainy but here they are more coarse.  I think we found...dirt!
		
		TyloInSpaceLow = The device measures a large impact, followed by many smaller impacts.
		TyloInSpaceHigh = That sound was not the result of an impact but rather was directly caused by space food.  KLANG!  THAT was in impact!
		
		BopInSpaceLow = Flight, Mission Control. You did not, in fact, just collide with Bop.
		BopInSpaceHigh = Mission Control, Flight.  Did we just collode with Bop?
		
		PolInSpaceLow = Judging from the impact, we may have impacted something crystalline in nature. 
		PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, polled politely, properly produced predicted principles of impacts.
		
		EelooInSpaceLow = Even out here, it seems spacecraft have to deal with space debris.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = We came, we saw, we got hit by more rocks.
		
		AsteroidInSpaceLow = Pieces of the asteroid seem to have broken off from the activity around it...
		AsteroidInSpaceHigh = WAIT!  No one said anything about rocks around the rock.
		AsteroidSrfLanded = The detector pings angrily as it is pelted from the debris of our landing.

	MohoInSpaceLow = The heat radiating from Moho thrashes the ions back and forth, exciting them even more. 
	MohoInSpaceHigh = The ions seem quite excited for being next to a flaming hot ball of gas and plasma. 
	EveInSpaceHigh = Eve appears to have no significant effect on happy ions that pass into the trap. 
	EveInSpaceLow = Eve's magnetosphere is smaller than Kerbin's. Data shows that her atmosphere is ripped off, however replenished by ferocious volcanic activity. 
	GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly appears to have no effect on ions and charged particles passing into the trap. 
	GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly must've never had a magnetosphere. Perhaps it's too small?

	MunInSpaceLow = The Mun does definitely have a magnetosphere. 
	MinmusInSpaceHigh = The data from the ion trap is inconclusive. It's unknown whether Minmus ever had a magnetosphere. 
	MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus shows promising data. Minmus must have once had a thin magnetosphere during the creation of the solar system. 
	DunaInSpaceHigh = Solar wind passes through the trap. The ions seem excited to be near such a red body. 
	DunaInSpaceLow = Solar plasma passes through the trap. Due to the miniscule magnetosphere, Duna's atmosphere is being mangled by the solar wind of Kerbol. 
	IkeInSpaceHigh = The ions around Ike are influenced by Duna's atmosphere being blown away by solar winds.
	IkeInSpaceLow = The ions around Ike are influenced by Duna's atmosphere being blown away by solar winds. 
	DresInSpaceHigh = The data shows a slight increase in electromagnetic readings. 
	DresInSpaceLow = Dres does, in fact, have a significant magnetosphere
	JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool's magnetosphere is strong all the way out here. Readings show that Jool's magnetosphere must reach past the orbit of Eeloo, concluding that this is, in fact, the largest planetary magnetosphere in the solar system...  
	JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's magnetosphere is stronger than anywhere else, yet! The high radioactivity is scrambling your good readings! 
	LaytheInSpaceHigh = The readings show a slight magnetosphere..
	LaytheInSpaceLow = The resemblance Laythe's magnetosphere shows compared to Kerbin makes you wonder about many things... 
	VallInSpaceHigh = These readings show no promising results... 
	VallInSpaceLow = You can now conclude that Vall may have never had a magnetosphere... 
	TyloInSpaceHigh = Ion trap readings show good evidence of a strong magnetosphere around Tylo. 
	TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo does indeed have a strong and tough magnetosphere according to the results. 
	BopInSpaceHigh = These readings show no promising results...
	BopInSpaceLow = You can conclude that Bop never had a magnetosphere. This is just more evidence to stack onto the "Bop is a captured asteroid" argument. 
	PolInSpaceHigh = These readings show no promising results... 
	PolInSpaceLow = The pollen grain which you call Pol seems to be just like her sister. No magnetosphere... 
	EelooInSpaceHigh = Little of the solar wind reaches this far out in the system. These readings aren't very promising...
	EelooInSpaceLow = Readings show that Eeloo might have a trace magnetosphere.

	 KerbinSrfLandedMountains = Metals of various types show up in trace quantities from the exposed mountainsides and raised rock from below the surface of the planet.
	 KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Some small levels of actual radioactive isotopes show up in minute quantities here.  Could be worth more checking?
	 KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The heavy pollution of leaked jet fuel nearly clogs the intake sensor making reading here very difficult.
	 KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = It's a flag pole.  What kind of actual science do you think it's going to give you?  
	 KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = Look at the satellite dish!  It's made of metal but the spectrometer doesn't detect it...hmmm...kick it!
	 KerbinSrfLandedVAB = This large metal building houses the legendary Kraken.  The spectrometer refuses to give any readings here out of fear.
	 KerbinSrfLandedR&D = Strong levels of methane and a lingering odor is detected from all the decaying BS2.
	 KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = A complex form of BS known as Poly(TiCaLi)-BS2 is strongly detected near this location.

	 KerbinSrfLandedSPH = The VAB is rumored to be the home of the Kraken but it summers at the SPH.  The spectrometer doesn't work here either.
	 KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = Rumors abound that money is paid for results in this locaiton.  You get the most precise readings of BS yet.

	 MinmusSrfLanded = As has long been expected, high levels of frozen water, nitrogen and methane are present along with strong salt lines.
	 MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = Readings from here show that several different major salts make up the bulk of the salinization lines present in the spectroscopic readings
	 MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = Strangely the salinity is not as strong here allowing more precise chemistry makeups to be identified from this location
	
	 SunInSpaceLow = The hydrogen and helium lines nearly overwhelm the detectors at this point which are already unstable due to high heat levels
	
	 MohoInSpaceLow = It appears the detectors caught a whiff of iron vapor it's so hot here

	 GillyInSpaceLow = Carbon, oxygen and carbon dioxide are all present in the readings along with the expected signs of silicates and carbonates
	 GillySrfLanded = Once landed, the levels of carbon spike considerably higher helping to confirm the theory that Gilly's core is mostly carbon
	
	 DunaInSpaceLow = Low levels of carbon dioxide and traces of nitrogen and methane are detected by the detectors
	 DunaSrfLanded = Atmospheric carbon dioxide is easily detectable from the surface and additional readings show several isotopes that were unexpected.
	
	 IkeInSpaceLow = Ike is so large and orbits so close to Duna the planet's carbon dioxide atmosphere litters the spectroscopic results with carbon and oxygen detections.
	 IkeSrfLanded = Molecular carbon and oxygen are still heavily detected but surface results provide strong readings geologists will be able to use to determine Ike's chemical makeup.
	
	 DresInSpaceLow = Spectroscopic results indicate a large presence of silicate and carbonate dust around the planet possibly coming from the local asteroid ring.
	 DresSrfLanded = Surface scans show Dres contains the presence of water ice throughout its crust and seem to indicate most cratering on the planet likely was the result of impacts from the local asteroid field.
	
	 JoolInSpaceLow = Strong detection lines of hydrogen and helium are present along with a number of H/He isotopes.  A fair amount of ammonia was expected but was not found.
	 LaytheInSpaceLow = Water, oxygen and various salts were expected.  The presence of trace amounts of chlorine was not.
	 LaytheSrfLanded = Surface scans confirm the waters of Laythe to contain high levels of salinity.  Atmospheric results also show ozone and trace amounts of chlorine making it completely unbreathable.
	 VallInSpaceLow = Water and nitrogen are both showing up strongly in the scanners results from orbit.
	 VallSrfLanded = The chemical makeup of the water at the surface suggest there are likely liquid oceans beneath the frozen outer layers of the moon.

	 BopSrfLanded = Surface scans reveal high concentrations of both carbon and iron oxide giving the moon its dark coloration.
	 PolInSpaceLow = With its distance from Jool, sulfur and phosphor from the surface can be detected from orbit.
	 PolSrfLanded = High concentrations of sulfur and sulfuric compounds along with high levels of phosphates leave the formation theories of Pol in flux and unconfirmed.

	 EelooSrfLanded = Spectroscopic scans of the surface show high levels of water ice and frozen nitrogen and methane.  They also indicate the surface is renewed or eroded in some way over time.
	
	 AsteroidInSpaceLow = Trace amounts of water along with silicate and carbonate compounds are found in most asteroids

	KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The administrators grumble about it and most of them aren't smiling but you manage to get a group photo of everyone except Stan whose head you cut off in the frame.
	KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The astronauts being who they are begin fighting to see who is going to be in the center of the group photo.  Unsurprisingly, Jeb won.
	KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The crawlerway is a long slab of concrete but your photo might one day make it into an abstract art gallery.
	KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = It's a damned flag pole.  And there's not flag flying today.  So you took a picture of a long metal stick.
	KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The details around the launch pad will be very popular with people playing the latest computer game - Human Space Program - a very popular game about a fictional race of creatures who go into space.
	KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The pictures from inside mission control were confiscated at the door by a vary large kerbal named Arnold.  You didn't argue.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&D = At first the researchers were extremely happy to have you photographing their experiments but when you started asking questions about what it revealed they got very angry and told you it was highly technical explosive blow uppie stuff and you wouldn't understand.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = You now have a picture of a large, unlabelled and unnamed concrete building.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = You now have another picture of another large concrete building and it happens to be on a corner.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = Yet another large concrete building.  You would really like to have pictures from inside but the researchers won't let you in since you were asking too many questions they couldn't answer.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = When you asked if you could attach your camera to the telescope to take some pictures they just looked at you funny.  You did get a good picture of the telescope itself though.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = Look, another concrete building.  You can tell your grandkids one day some amazing story about something that didn't happen to you at this building.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = For just a moment, you thought you saw peering out of the window what appeared to be a tall, vaguely kerbal shaped figure with pinkish-brown skin, a roudn head and nearly 4 times the height of a normal kerbal.  It was disturbing and unfortunately the photo you took was blurred.  No one will believe you.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = It's a large tank filled with something that you are unable to identify and the researchers refuse to tell you what it is.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = The photos of the latest wind tunnel test of the new launch vehicle were confiscated by Arnold the Giant Kerbal again.  Newspapers are reporting a resounding success but you know better.  You just don't have evidence to prove it anymore.  The kerballed test is going forward.
	KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The photos of landing aircraft you took have turned out extremely well and appeared in Kane's Defense Weekly.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPH = Several pictures of the latest generation of space planes have made their way into the public and you're being blamed for it.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = You should go back to the runway for more pictures of aircraft.  The photos of large concrete buildings just aren't as interesting.

	KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = If Jeb's beer isn't in the round tank, it has to be here.  Unfortunately, if you're wrong when you open the tank it will likely mean your death.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = On the hunt for Jeb's beer storage tank you have taken photos of the water tower.  Unfortunately Arnold the Giant Kerbal told you to come down halfway in your climb to the top to prove your theory.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = As you start taking photos of the large comm dishes in the area, you see a black government car pull up but no one gets out.  They're just sitting there.  Watching you.

	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = Four kerbals wearing black suits and ties with dark sunglasses have all gotten out of the car.  One of them is talking to his wrist for some reason while looking directly at you taking your photographs.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = As you hurry around the corner to the south dish you run head on into Arnold followed by one of the government suits.  There's a blinding flash of light and when you wake up no one is there, you can't remember anything and your camera is empty of all photos.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You were able to snap a shot of the hub but at the distance you took the picture it looks like nothing more than a mobile home with three large satellite dishes in the front yard.
	KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The VAB is so tall you had to lay on the ground to fit it in the frame.  You've won a $50 prize for an abstract photo contest with this image.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = After winning your $50 photo contest with your other VAB shot you decided to try the same thing again.  Unfortunately this is old hat now and everyone is taking pictures by lying on the ground now.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = The memorial is a somber reminder of all the brave souls who came before and gave their lives in service to the greater good.  That's what the researchers and engineers who blew them up say anyway.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The hunt for Jeb's beer storage continues...
	KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex = The engineers chose this location for their group photo.  It was lovely and all 219 asked you to make a copy of it for them.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The ground crew chose this location for their ground photo.  You are nearly positive they were using this as a pretense to protect Jeb's beer storage.
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = It really was much easier to fit the entire KSC in an image from the air.  Climbing to the top of the VAB just didn't cut it but you still got a resonably good shot of the grounds.
	
	KerbinSrfLanded = Haven't you seen this before? 
	KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Large rolling fields of long grass with very few trees create a pastoral image you couldn't pass up.

	MunSrfLandedEastCrater = Photos of the East Crater are helping to answer some of the fundamental questions regarding the Mun's surface and how it has been affected by large imapacts.
	MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = Imaging data from this "smaller" impact has proven just as important as that from the large craters around the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = A favorite landing site of many, photographic evidence helps to reveal this crater to be one of the oldest on the surface.
	MunSrfLandedHighland = The highland regions of the Mun appear to have been formed during a period where the surface of the Mun was still geologically active.
	MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = These small impact craters are younger and therefore photographic data helps to answer many questions about the different impact eras of the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedMidlands = As with other regions on the Mun, imaging data shows the midlands appear to have been thrust upward during a geologically active period on the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = As with other smaller impact regions, the midland craters are shown through photo evidence to be younger than other impact areas around the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = This gigantic basin appears to be the result of molten rock flowing over the surface in the distant past.  Imaging data from the surface does not help to answer what may have caused it to flow in the first place.
	MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = This enormous impact region was formed during the earliest days of the Mun's formation which imaging data will help understand.
	MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = This high latitude impact region was formed around the same time as the Northwest Crater making it among the oldest areas of the Mun.  Photographic data from this region helps to reveal details of this impact and its aftermath.
	MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The polar lowlands appear to be a region formed during a geologically active period and was affected by the mammoth impact events occuring during that time.  Photographic evidence of this region helps to reveal how these processes interacted.
	MunSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the poles is helping to answer questions about the formation of the Mun and whether resources that could assist in creating a surface base exists.
	MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The Southwest Crater was also formed around the same time as the other colossal sized craters on the surface.  Photographic evidence is helping to answer many of the questions surrounding this violent time of the Mun's history.
	MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = Formed when two bodies in orbit around each other collided with the Mun, photos of the Twin Craters have shown this region to be younger than originally thought				
	MunSrfLanded = The ground is very grey. Around you, there are slopes and mountains.
			MunInSpaceLow = Closer to the moon now, you see that craters have ravaged the surface. Even the plains are unforgiven, which makes you infer that time has taken its toll on the Mun's surface... 
				MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun appears to be very cratered while the lowlands sit pristinely below all of the mountains. 

	MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = In pictures, the gently rolling lowlands almost appear to be the surface of roiling sea of melted mint ice cream.
	MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The highland regions of Minmus are difficult to separate from other regions in photos requiring altitude measurements to know when the transition occured.
	MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = The highly irregular slopes of Minmus have often been observed in photos as appearing to be "scoops of ice cream" on the surface.
	MinmusSrfLandedFlats = It's flat, punctuated by a sharp increase in altitude around the perimeter.  Images help to show just how nearly perfectly level this region really is.
	MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = One of the largest flatland regions on the surface, in pictures the great flats appear to be a perfectly smooth frozen lake of green liquid.
	MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The largest continuous flat region on the surface, the Greater Flats may once have been a sea of liquid on the surface that has long since frozen.  Images from this region reveal just how large it is as certain areas actually go to the horizon with no change in appearance.
	MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = These smaller flat regions appear regularly around the moon and likely were small lakes at some point.  Photos taken in this region are surrounded on all sides by large hills forming the slopes and higher regions of Minmus.
	MinmusSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the poles is helping to answer questions whether Minmus was once a comet that was captured by Kerbin or whether some alien race simply spilled their giant bowl of mint ice cream.  Researchers are inclined to believe the former but the general public is another question...
	MinmusSrfLanded = The minty colored surface amazes you as you stare above and below where you have taken this photo. 
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus reveals varying terrain. High plateaus stretch for kilometres and the plains below them stretch even farther. 
				MinmusInSpaceHigh = From so far away, Minmus resembles a small scoop of mint ice cream... 
	
	MohoSrfLandedHighlands = Surface photos in the highlands reveal Moho had to have been volcanically active at some point in the past.  Lava fields and other geologic formations of this region could only have been formed by such activity.
	MohoSrfLandedMidlands = Photos taken within the midland region lend further support to the idea that much of Moho's surface has been shaped by volcanism.
	MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters = These various small craters are numerous on the surface of Moho and photos within them are helping to answer some of the questions about it's geologically active periods.
	MohoSrfLandedNorthPole = Unlike it's polar opposite, the north pole of Moho is extremely irregular and cratered with vastly different high and low points.  Photographic evidence clearly shows the highly varied surface.
	MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole = At one time, stories were rampant that an enormous hole existed in this region which penetrated deep into the planet.  Photographic evidence has shown this not to be true.  The public outcry of a government cover-up has reached epic proportions.
	MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge = A long, narrow ridge spanning a good deal of this sinkhole region shows up starkly in photographs.  It is believed to be the product of volcanism but more study will be needed.
	MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands = The lowland regions of the planet are home to numerous small craters and dune like rock formations shown repeatedly in pictures of these regions.

	MohoSrfLandedSouthWesternLowlands = The lowland regions in the west, just like the other lowland areas of the planet are home to clear geologic formations created by volcanism and photo evidence will help to fill in gaps in our knowledge of this world.
	MohoSrfLandedSouthEasternLowlands = Further study of the various lowland regions in image data will all help to identify the causes of Moho's volcanic past and will help in the study of tidal erosion caused by the sun.
	MohoSrfLandedCanyon = The deep canyons and sharp walls are further evidence of geologic activity on the planet as no liquid could have eroded this region.  Photo evidence helps to support the idea this region was created through volcanic activity.
	MohoSrfLandedSouthPole = The south pole of Moho is similar in appearance and formation as the various lowlands.  Nearly uniform in altitude with very few craters or differences in high and low points, image data reveals this to be as different from the north pole in appearance as it is in location.
	MohoSrfLanded = After your descent, you see the distinct features of the planet. Craters are visible as far as the eye can see. 
		MohoInSpaceLow = Craters become clear on Moho's surface. With immense detail, the craters have craters. This reminds you that you are too close for comfort... 
			MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho floats far away, punished with craters. You can almost see the heat of the home star, Kerbol... 

	EveSrfLanded = The purple sand of this dense planet stretches across the surface. You get hungry and wonder if this sand is toxic if eaten... 
	EveSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the surface shows just how uniform and regular the poles of Eve really are.  Slight variations in altitude are revealed but very little in the way of extensive surface features exist to break up the nearly flat regions.
	EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = A vast, low lying sea of liquid hydrocarbons shows vividly purple in image data.  It is quite obvious that the coloration caused by the hydrocarbons in both the sea and atmosphere lends Eve its distinct appearance.
	EveSrfLandedLowlands = Very low altitudes and gentle, rolling landscapes make up most of the lowlands creating a very purple picturesque image.
	EveSrfLandedMidlands = Similar to the lowlands, the midlands differ primarily in their altitude.  The same rolling landscape with very little in the way of features is captured clearly in image data.

	GillySrfLandedMidlands = The midlands, like the other regions of this barren rock, is as irregular as it is odd looking.  The beige color of the surface shows up in sharp cut relief against the walls of valleys and mountains.
	GillySrfLandedHighlands = The highland regions are more erratic in shape, altitude and slope than any other region of this small body causing long shadows and prominent peaks to be cast in stark relief of the image data.
		GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly, a beige captured asteroid reveals very extreme terrain. A blur in the photo shows its fast rotation. 
			GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly barely resembles a dot in the photo.

	DunaSrfLandedMidlands = The midlands lack a defining boundary between regions making it difficult to determine where the highlands end, the midlands begin and the lowland take over.  Further evidence within the imaging data of past geological activity will leave researchers in a tizzy for several years you're sure.
		DunaFlyingLow = Surface details showing erosion, weather activity and long term geologic activity is easily seen in photographs from low altitude.
			DunaFlyingHigh = The details of the surface have faded but large scale features revealing long term changes to the surface is unmistakable in photos from high altitude.

	IkeSrfLanded = The pictures show rocky evidence of recent tectonic activity.	
	IkeSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The polar lowlands are one of the few fairly level regions of Ike's surface.  It is unknown whether this is formerly an impact crater or simply a surface feature and photos do not help to determine the answer to this nagging question.
	IkeSrfLandedMidlands = Like the majority of the Ike, the midlands are a broken landscape marked by vastly different altitudes, steep slopes and cliffs and a distinct lack of craters all of which is revealed in imaging data.
	IkeSrfLandedLowlands = The lowlands of Ike are deep depressions in the surface at much lower altitudes than most of the moon.  Imaging data shows the transition regions of these areas to be extremely steep and rising quickly to mountain ridges and the higher altitudes of the midlands.
	IkeSrfLandedEasternMountainRidge = The tallest peak on the surface can be found along the Eastern Mountain Ridge and proves to be one of the best places to take wife field images of the surface.
	IkeSrfLandedWesternMountainRidge = The Western Mountain Ridge, although lower in over all altitude, spans almost the entire surface of Ike from pole to pole and it's many plateuas would be very picturesque if it you could actually see anything.  Unfortunately, this region faces away from Duna at all times leaving it largely in darkness due to the low levels of sunlight.
	IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = The Central Mountain Range, on average, is even lower in altitude than the western ridge but it faces Duna at all times.  This creates opporunities for stunning views across the surface of Ike and out into space towards Duna which you take advantage of with your camera.
	IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = Like the Western Mountain Ridge, the Easter Range is located on the side of Ike facing away from Duna leaving it in shadowy darkness most of the time.  Your images do littel to illuminate this area.
	IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The South Pole of Ike is a colossal plateau towering over 9000m in most places.  It also has a fairly level average surface slope making it an excellent place for landing and research.  However, due to Ike's axial tilt, it faces away from Duna and mostly lies in shadow except in the most westerly areas of the region making your image data difficult to interpret.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike shows its weathered terrain quite clearly. Mountain ranges dominate the surface while the plains come in dark, large patches. 
			IkeInSpaceHigh = The rock we call Ike is massive. It appears to be quite dense from so far away. It also appears to have very rugged terrain, more so than your own moon.

	DresSrfLandedHighlands = The highlands of Dres are not exactly high in comparison to similar regions of the solar system so named.  They are small in area and are largely devoid of craters in photos.  Odd considering they are technically supposed to be the tallest and most exposed regions of the planet.

	DresSrfLandedImpactEjecta = The impact regions of Dres are surrounded by tiny regions of ejecta blankets where debris from the collision spreds out from the impact site.  Photo evidence clearly shows how small these locales really are.
	DresSrfLandedImpactCraters = Like other bodies lacking an atmosphere, Dres has impact craters although very few of them in comparion.  Your image data of suspected impact zones may help to identify others.
	DresSrfLandedCanyons = The canyons of Dres have some of the steepest and tallest walls you have seen yet.  Photos of the region are difficult to analyze because these zones are in nearly constant shadow from the cliff sides.
