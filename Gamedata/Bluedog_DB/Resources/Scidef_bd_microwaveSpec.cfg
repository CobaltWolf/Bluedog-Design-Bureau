	RESULTS
	{
	default = You measure the brightness of the body below in the instrument's view.
	default = The photometer takes local brightness measurements.
	default = Albedo of the surface below is measured with the instrument.

	SunInSpace = The Sun is extraordinarily bright. Are you surprised?
	SunInSpaceLow = Mission control messages "DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN"
	SunInSpaceLow = IR measurements briefly go off the charts before the instrument enters safe-mode to prevent damage
	SunInSpaceHigh = Kerbol is bright, very bright.

	MohoInSpaceLow = Some large areas appear darker than the rest of the planet. You should send a camera to take a proper look.
	MohoInSpaceHigh = The Kerbol-facing side of Moho appears very bright although maybe not as bright as you would expect.

	EveInSpaceLow = Eve seems to have a nearly continous level of surface brightness. Is it a perfectly smooth body? Or perhaps its covered in thick cloud?
	EveInSpaceHigh = The photometry data shows this planet to be brighter than Kerbin.

		GillyInSpaceLow = The results are quite even despite imaging from quite close up. The surface must be quite smooth.
		GillyInSpaceHigh = This small body is returning rather dim results despite proximity to the Sun.

	KerbinInSpaceLow = The brightness levels change from moment to moment. Can we reconstruct the cloud patterns from such rudimentary data?
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = Telling apart surface features from clouds is quite difficult with a simple measurement of light intensity.

		MunInSpaceLow = The variations are small but frequent. The far side seems as interesting as the near side, we should definitely send more complex instruments to investigate further.
		MunInSpaceHigh = To our surprise it seems fairly easy to match the brightness measurements to telescope obervations of the near side surface.

		MinmusInSpaceLow = The photometry shows significant areas of perfectly level results. Flats or plains perhaps?
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = They say Minmus is minty green. Can't really tell with this instrument.

	DunaInSpaceLow = Dissapointingly there seems to be little evidence of cloud layers on Duna. Perhaps it has a thin atmosphere.
	DunaInSpaceHigh = The poles of Duna seem a lot brighter than the rest of the surface, could there be ice?

		IkeInSpaceLow = We're not getting much useful results from Ike. We'll need a more sophisticated instrument to study the surface.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = This body is darker than we expected.

	JoolInSpaceLow = Jool is returning a lot of variation vertically but not laterally. If there are clouds on this purported gas giant, they must be in bands.
	JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool is big. And it seems quite bright despite its distance from the Sun.

		LaytheInSpaceLow = A great deal of variation is measured and the bright areas seem to move a lot. Could it be? A Joolian moon with an atmosphere?
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = Laythe seems reasonably bright with a lot of variation, lets move the instrument into a lower orbit for a closer look.

		VallInSpaceLow = Vall seems quite bright all things considered. Some of the science team are claiming it could be covered in ice.
		VallInSpaceHigh = The surface of Vall seems quite varied.

		BopInSpaceLow = A closer look suggests Bop is probably a bit lumpy but not heavily cratered.
		BopInSpaceHigh = Bop is tiny and there doesnt seem much interesting about the brightness results.

		TyloInSpaceLow = Adjusted for distance, the results for Tylo seems kind of similar to the Mun. Don't you wonder what it really looks like?
		TyloInSpaceHigh = Like most of Jool's moons, the results show variations in brightness suggesting an interesting surface. We must investigate further.

		PolInSpaceLow = The science team have analyzed the results and think Pol might have some strange terrain. We'll need a much higher resolution instrument to know more though.
		PolInSpaceHigh = Pol's albedo is darker than some of the other Joolian moons. Perhaps it has a strange colour too?

	EelooInSpaceLow = Up close, it seems Eeloo is brighter than expected after accounting for its distance from the Sun. Another candidate for an icy body perhaps?
	EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo is so far from the Sun its difficult to get a useful result from a basic photometer.
