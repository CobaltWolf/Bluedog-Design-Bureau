	RESULTS
	{
		default = Collected an observation of the weather below the spacecraft.
		default = The clouds below make a pretty pattern... Look, that one looks like Jeb!
		default = Nothing to see here. Maybe you'll spot some clouds later in your orbit?
		default = The whole image is white! Did the camera fail? Nope, it's just a lot of clouds.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The image you get provides a "big picture" of the weather across the planet. The Meterology team will love this!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = This image of the large-scale weather patterns allows scientists to see how different weather fronts interact. This will help us refine our weather models.
		kerbinInSpaceHigh = The picture you get is quite pretty. We should hang it on the wall in the snack room!
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = It's hard to pick out the clouds against the ice caps below them. The scientists will need to think this over some more...
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = So that's what a blizzard looks like from space.
		KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = Looks like another snowstorm rolling down towards the Woomerang Launch Site. We should tell them that's coming.
		KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = There's not much going on aside from cloud cover... Oh. That's ice, not clouds. Dang it!
		KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = That's a nasty snowstorm down there... Glad we're near the equator!
		KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = It sure looks cold down there. Glad we're not manning that research outpost!
		KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = Are those clouds? They are? Woohoo! SCIENCE!
		KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = That's a lot of ice. But not much else going on right now.
		KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = Hey, did the ice shift from the last time we took pictures down here?
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = You see several snowstorms marching across the area.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = All that snow falling looks cold.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = Is it raining? Yes? Whoa... talk about a heat wave.
		KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = The clear skies below are accompanied by colder than normal temperatures.
		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The weather is highly unstable in the area, varying wildly throughout the day.
		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = Hey, where'd the clouds that were there last orbit go?
		KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = Wait, where did that storm come from? And is that snow?
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The rugged terrain causes storms to form along the mountains.
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The large amount of cloud cover makes it hard to see what's going on down below.
		KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The clear skies make you think of your last kamping trip to the mountains.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The spring thunderstorms can get quite sizeable. We should warn people in the path of them.
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = So that's what a thunderstorm looks like from space! Oooh, was that lightning?
		KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = What was that old saying about April showers? Yeah... it's about to rain, why do you ask?
		KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = Not a cloud in sight.
		KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = So that's what a sandstorm looks like from space.
		KerbinInSpaceLowDeserts = The clear skies don't tell you much, but you can guess it's going to be hot down there.
		KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = That's a big thunderstorm. We might want to warn people nearby to watch out for flash floods.
		KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = Winter cloud cover blankets the region below, preventing you from seeing anything else of value.
		KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = The celar skies don't tell you much, but the terrain below sure looks rugged.
		KerbinInSpaceLowShores = What a perfect day to go to the beach!
		KerbinInSpaceLowShores = The clear skies down't tell you much, but that storm you saw out to sea on the last orbit should be making for some nice surf.
		KerbinInSpaceLowShores = It's overcast and rainy on the coast. Suddenly, you're glad you have to work Tommatt's shift in the weather center today.
		KerbinInSpaceLowWater = So that's what a hurricane looks like from space.
		KerbinInSpaceLowWater = Uh-oh. That cyclone is headed for shore. We'd best warn everyone to get out of the way!
		KerbinInSpaceLowWater = The clear skies don't tell you much about the weather, but you can certainly see the wakes of passing ships below.
		EveInSpaceHigh = Your high perch above the Purple Planet gives you an excellent view of... lots of clouds.
		EveInSpaceHigh = Close observation reveals several differences between areas of cloud cover. Perhaps there's more to Eve than just the clouds?
		EveInSpaceLow = Getting closer seems to help you find holes in the clouds to peek through.
		EveInSpaceLow = The gaps in the clouds reveal "rain" of an unknown fluid and storms similar to those on Kerbin.
		EveInSpaceLowExplodiumSea = The clouds here are actually quite thick here. What gaps you get allow you to see the sea below, steaming.
		EveInSpaceLowExplodiumSea = The thickness of the clouds here seem to point to a sizeable source of moisture below.
		EveInSpaceLowOlympus = There's a mountain poking through the clouds!
		DunaInSpaceHigh = From your perch high above Duna, you can watch for dust storms well before they threaten any of our missions.
		DunaInSpaceHigh = There's not many clouds on Duna. Maybe the thinner atmosphere has something to do with that?
		DunaInSpaceHigh = The dust storms you spot look similar to sandstorms on Kerbin. Perhaps studying the closer of the two can help you understand the further away one?
		DunaInSpaceLow = The few clouds you spy seem to be made entirely of ice crystals. The folks who wanted to see life on Duna will be disappointed to hear there's no rain.
		DunaInSpaceLowPoles = What few clouds you do find over Duna seem to congregate around the poles. Perhaps something about the conditions at the poles is causing the clouds to form?
		DunaInSpaceLowPolarHighlands = There's a few scattered clouds lurking around the edges of the polar highlands, but nothing over them. This may be a good spot for a solar powered base.
		DunaInSpaceLowPolarCraters = CLouds or fog tend to fill the craters in the early morning, but they dissapate as the sun fully hits them.
		DunaInSpaceLowHighlands = The few wisps of clouds you spot largely flow around the Highlands, rather than over. The meterology team can use this to plot wind patterns and speed.
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlands = The late afternoon winds tend to kick up localized dust storms.
		DunaInSpaceLowLowlands = The occasional dust storm rolls through this region, but little else of note occurs.
		DunaInSpaceLowCraters = The lower portions of craters seem to avoid the winds, and are filled with dust. Perhaps there's some connection?
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlandSea = Whoever named this area was clearly not paying attention... there's no water here. Not much weather either, but that seems to be typical around here.
		DunaInSpaceLowNortheastBasin = There is the occasional bit of fog spotted swirling around in the southern reaches of the crater, but it never lasts long.
		DunaInSpaceLowSouthernBasin = There is the occasional bit of fog spotted swirling around in the nothern reaches of the crater, but it never lasts long.
		DunaInSpaceLowNorthernShelf = Clouds are frequently seen on the downwind side of the shelf... wait, is that snow there, too?
		DunaInSpaceLowMidlandCanyon = You keeps seeing fog in the mornings lurking in the bottom of the canyon, and duststorms run through the canyon in the afternoon.
		DunaInSpaceLowEasternCanyon = You keep seeing fog in the mornings lurking in the bottom of the canyon, and duststorms run through the canyon in the afternoon.
		DunaInSpaceLowWesternCanyon = You keep seeing fog in the mornings lurking in the bottom of the canyon, and duststorms run through the canyon in the afternoon.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = From high above the cloudtops of Jool, the pattern of bands is very clear. Not much else is, though... the scientists won't have much to work with.
		JoolInSpaceHigh = From high above the cloudtops of Jool, you can see the occasional storm. But because of the distances involved, you can't really get much detail. Maybe a closer look will tell you more?
		JoolInSpaceLow = From just above the atmosphere of Jool, you don't get as much of a "big picture" view. The details, however... aren't much better. Just lots and lots of clouds.
		JoolInSpaceLow = Now that you're closer to Jool, the sheer scale of the storms you saw earlier becomes evident. Some of these hurricanes are big enough to span a fair portion of Kerbin's surface!
		JoolInSpaceLow = You don't see much deeper than the first cloud layer, but what you do see will help scientists better understand what's going on inside Jool.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = From high above Laythe, you notice that there's no cyclonic storms. The meterology team's going to be scratching their heads over this one.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = There's not any significant storm activity... mostly scattered thunderstorms around the islands near the local "afternoon".
		LaytheInSpaceLowPoles = There's not much weather here... only the occasional rainstorm turned snowstorm.
		LaytheInSpaceLowShores = The lack of hurricane activity makes this an attractive location for a resort. Maybe someone will open one here someday?
		LaytheInSpaceLowShores = The low gravity and steady winds make for large surf. Perhaps the first crew to visit should pack a surfboard...
		LaytheInSpaceLowDunes = The steady winds of Laythe, combined with the low gravity, make for some massive sand dunes.
		LaytheInSpaceLowCrescentBay = The surf here is much lower than elsewhere on the shores. Perhaps this would make for a good swimming hole.
		LaytheInSpaceLowCraterBay = The splash rim of the crater seems to help deflect the worst of the weather around the bay. This may be an ideal spot to operate a seaplane out of...
		LaytheInSpaceLowPeaks = The peaks of Laythe are covered in snow and whipped by winds. Not a pleasant place to be, for sure.
		LaytheInSpaceLowShallows = Most of the thunderstorm activity on Laythe seems to originate from the shallows, where the water is warmest.
		LaytheInSpaceLowCraterIsland = The island is well protected from most of the weather by the crater rim.
		LaytheInSpaceLowTheSagenSea = Not a single hurricane in sight. Why might that be?
		LaytheInSpaceLowTheSagenSea = The large expanse of open, deep water seems to kill off any storms that cross over it.
		LaytheInSpaceLowDegrasseSea = The deep, open water doesn't seem to support storm formation well.
		//SunInSpace = Why are you using this instrument here? Back to the VAB with you.
