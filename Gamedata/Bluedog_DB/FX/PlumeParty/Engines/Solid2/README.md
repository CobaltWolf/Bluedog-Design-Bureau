## Solid Rockets
Solid rockets are cheap and expendable, but they have a place in the Plume Party. The Virgin family is inspired by the iconic flight of Virgin Galactic's Spaceship Two which was stratolaunched and ascended beyond the Karman Line.

Be advised that the smoke plumes (**Fume**) for SL and Heavy are trailing smoke while the other two are not. Virgin Heavy is optimized for 2.5m or wider nozzles.
