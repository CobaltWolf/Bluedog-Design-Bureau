## Wheesley /Subsonic series
I was advised against making such fiery plumes for turbofan engines but for now these will persist because they look cool. Well, they _don't have to be_ used on turbofan engines, right?

## TurboColor series
A subset of plumes for afterburning turbofan engines. A generic bunch, its members are identical except for color. The outer plume body should be thicker/more opaque than this. Will fix soonâ„¢

## Afterburn (P&W) series
