## Hypergol series
A hypergolic propellant combination used in a rocket engine is one whose components spontaneously ignite when they come into contact with each other. The inherant hazard aside, they are great for supplementing most other rocket engines which have limited ignitions and tend to require ullage. The two color variants are based upon the actual colors of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and [Dinitrogen Tetroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide) (N2O4).
