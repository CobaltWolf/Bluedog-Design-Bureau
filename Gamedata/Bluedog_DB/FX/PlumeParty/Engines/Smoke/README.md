## Engine Smoke

Because Squad's prefab particles just aren't enough. The rainbow is (or will be) available here in trailing and non-trailing editions. Predicted keys for identifying smoke are:
* **S, M, L:** scales, for the engine sizes they target. __Emission radius__, as much as particle size and speed, is a defining factor in these.
* **F, B:** for Faint and Bold for alternate intensities.

**Warning:** The trailing smoke here will persist in vacuum and fall away at orbital velocities and look weird so try to use these only on sea level rockets and air-breathing engines. The prefab vacuum cutoff switch was nver made available in KSP PartTools.
