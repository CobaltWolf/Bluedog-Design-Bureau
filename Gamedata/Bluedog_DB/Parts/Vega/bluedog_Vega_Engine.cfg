	description = One of the first large upper stages designed, the Vejur was meant be an interim upper stage until the Inon came online. After the secret military upper stage Belle was made available for sale to space programs, development of the Vejur was abandoned until investors paid for its conclusion. The 'Decker' is a modified version of the 'Viking' engine, and so lacks the efficiency of a dedicated upper stage.
