	title = Viklun-UKSK "Dine" Experimental Liquid Engine
	manufacturer = North American
	description = Experimentations with the Viking engine also resulted in this bizarre contraption - the Dine. Essentially it is three thrust chambers strapped together. Thrust is significantly improved, but efficiency is nothing to write home about. The immense thrust makes this engine particularly unstable, and almost guaranteed to explode if ran for any significant period of time. But we know you'll keep using it anyways. Use at your own risk.
