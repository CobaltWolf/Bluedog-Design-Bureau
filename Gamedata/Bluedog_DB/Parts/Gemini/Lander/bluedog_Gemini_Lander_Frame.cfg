	description = Descent tank for the Dona Lander system. Place under the engine and adjust upwards to rest just under the lander can. The descent stage can decouple using a built in decoupler. Meant to have 4x legs attached, but you can probably get away with less if you're brave. The ladder can be toggled in the VAB for uncrewed landers.
