	description = This special docking port is designed to capture the Leo nose cone's docking mechanism. The simple mechanical connection won't even allow you to transfer resources, much less crew, but it will securely attach two vessels together, for berthing or travel. This low profile model needs to be deployed in order to dock. Be warned, it is not as forgiving as its larger sibling.
