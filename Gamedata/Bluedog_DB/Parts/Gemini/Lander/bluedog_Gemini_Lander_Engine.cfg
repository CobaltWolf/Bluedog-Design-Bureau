	description = This remarkable simple and robust engine might not be the best in terms of thrust or efficiency, but its light weight and small size makes it ideal for small, lightweight landers. A single example is used as both the descent and ascent engine of the Dona lander, using the empty toroidal descent stage tank as a takeoff platform.
