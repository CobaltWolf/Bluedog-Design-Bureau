	description = A hemispherical cap designed to terminate station modules that don't need a docking port or other inline parts attached past it. An attachment node is still provided to aid in mating the module to the launch vehicle. Optionally, it can also act as a 0.9375m to 0.625m adapter if the central cover is removed.
