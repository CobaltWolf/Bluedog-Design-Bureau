	description  = Due to the inherent imprecise nature (or at least, difficulty) of solid-based launch vehicles, they benefit from the addition of a controllable, liquid terminal stage. For the Minerva launch vehicle family, this was the "Kehrl" Orbital Assist Module. Featuring 6 spherical monopropellant tanks, 6 RCS thrusters for 3-way attitude control, and four additional RCS thrusters wired to an engine control circuit for prograde thrust. Useful for refining the orbit of your satellites, or deploying ridesharing satellites to different orbits.
