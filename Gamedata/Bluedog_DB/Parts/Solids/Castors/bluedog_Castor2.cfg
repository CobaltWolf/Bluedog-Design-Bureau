  description = Derived from an in line second stage for an all solid small launcher, this strap on solid booster can help you get more TWR and Delta-V out of your first stage. Attach it to a radial decoupler and let-er-rip! The Discouri 1 was used on early thrust augmented Daleth rockets and Discouri 2 was used on subsequent upgrades through to Daleth 2000.
