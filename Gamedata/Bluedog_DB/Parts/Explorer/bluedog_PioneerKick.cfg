	manufacturer = Bluedog Design Bureau
	description = Set of 8 extremely small rocket boosters on a 0.125m mount. Only really useful for putting distance between a probe and it's mother craft. The motors may or may not have been stolen from a model rocket kit belonging to a BDB engineer's son. It features BDB's SafeSolid™ system, allowing the engine to be shut down in flight, and since it's a cluster of engines restarted again, allowing for more accurate orbital insertions and manuevers. Not that you'll have much time to activate it.
