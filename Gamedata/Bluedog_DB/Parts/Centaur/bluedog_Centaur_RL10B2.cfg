	title = Inon-R-10B2 "Eisorau" Cryogenic Engine
	manufacturer = Bluedog Design Bureau
	description = While the R-10A41 "Sorau" was a marked improvement in some applications, there were others that needed an even larger engine, but with the efficiency of the R-10 engine family. The R-10B2 "Eisorau" features an even larger engine bell extension, which increases performance but also prevents it from being mounted in some configurations. Be sure to check that any tanks connected to it are filled with the correct propellants, and remember its fuel will boil off over time. Although originally designed for a theoretical Daleth cryogenic stage, theres nothing stopping you from using it on an Inon!
