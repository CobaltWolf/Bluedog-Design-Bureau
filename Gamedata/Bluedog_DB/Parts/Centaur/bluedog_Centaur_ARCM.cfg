	description = Later versions of the Bossart rocket replaced the complicated and expensive vernier system with this self contained thruster block. A small spherical monoprop tank is connected to 4 RCS thrusters, capable of maintaining roll authority, and the entire assembly is encased in an aerodynamic housing. Traditionally a single unit is placed on the interstage for the Inon upper stage.
