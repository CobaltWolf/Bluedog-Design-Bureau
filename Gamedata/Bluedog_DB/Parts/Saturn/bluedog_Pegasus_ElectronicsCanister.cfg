	description = A unique and robust probe core, the Condor-SUS "Boxy" probe core is a rectangular electronics cansiter that houses various satellite equipment and systems. This probe core was designed specifically for satellites that are integrated with their upper stages, this one being specifically designed for the Sarnus S-IV mounted Condor satellite. As a result, this probe core does not have very large batteries as it is meant to rely on the batteries of its upper stage. Despite this, it can be repurposed for other uses and comes with equipment such as a built-in direct antenna, reaction wheels, and small aft mounted thermal control radiators.
