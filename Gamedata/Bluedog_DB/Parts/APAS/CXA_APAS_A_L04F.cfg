description = Common Androgynous Docking Port. Developed to eliminate the limitations of the gendered Kane docking system, as well as provide a larger passageway for delivering cargo. Equipped with a deployable capture ring to dampen impact. Permanent station ports can use the passive version, which is simpler and lighter. Design, development and construction subcontracted to CxAerospace.
