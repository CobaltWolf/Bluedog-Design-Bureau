	description = RCS module designed to fit inside the fairing of an upper stage engine, to help you orient your upper stages before performing burns. Includes a tiny monopropellant bottle. Attach to the side of the tank, near the bottom. The thruster is small, so don't try and use it on too big of a stage. //'
