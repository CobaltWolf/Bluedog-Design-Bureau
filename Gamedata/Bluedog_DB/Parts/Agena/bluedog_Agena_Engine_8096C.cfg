	manufacturer = Bluedog Design Bureau
	description = This advanced variant of the Belle RLX81 engine family is more specialized that the rest. Using a scaled down and optimized thrust chamber and a large nozzle extension, it is able to reach very high ISPs given its propellant mix. The drawback is that it sacrifices a full quarter of its thrust, meaning its use case is different than the others.
