	description = This advanced 0.9375m engine includes darn near everything you would need for an upper stage or spacefaring probe, except for fuel. And a payload. It does, however, include three monopropellant bottles, a full RCS attitude control system, a monopropellant fuel cell, batteries, and a powerful vacuum engine. The sides of the truss section can be fitted with solar panels, 'Nafuni' secondary engines, or even subsatellites, depending on the mission profile.
