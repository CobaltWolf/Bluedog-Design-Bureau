	description = Convert your Belle upper stage into a fully featured satellite bus with this equipment rack. It contains attitude control thrusters, monopropellant storage, and extra batteries. The sides of the truss section can also be fitted with solar panels, 'Nafuni' secondary engines, or even subsatellites, depending on the mission profile. Attach to the engine mount, and then place the engine inside.
