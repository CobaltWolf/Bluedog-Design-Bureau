  title = Bossart-BT1-700 Balloon Fuel Tank
	manufacturer = Bluedog Design Bureau
	description = 0.9375m / 1.25m adapter fuel tank for the Bossart 1.875m launcher. The extremely thin walls of this tank are kept in tension by the pressure of the fuel (and pressurant gas as the fuel is used), providing a rigidity similar to a soda can. While extremely resilient, it cannot have other components radially attached to it, as doing so would compromise the structural integrity.
