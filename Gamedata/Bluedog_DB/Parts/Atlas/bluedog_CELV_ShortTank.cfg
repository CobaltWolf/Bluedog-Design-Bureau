  description = Small fuel tank for the Bossart-ADLV launcher. The extremely thin walls of this tank are kept in tension by the pressure of the fuel (and pressurant gas as the fuel is used), providing a rigidity similar to a soda can. While extremely resilient, it cannot have other components radially attached to it, as doing so would compromise the structural integrity.
