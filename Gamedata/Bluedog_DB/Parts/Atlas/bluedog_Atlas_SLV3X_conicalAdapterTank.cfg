	description = Conical adapter fuel tank for the 2.5m Bossart-1X launcher. The extremely thin walls of this tank are kept in tension by the pressure of the fuel (and pressurant gas as the fuel is used), providing a rigidity similar to a soda can. This adapter tank is available with 1.875m and 0.9375m top node variants.
