	description = Main fuel tank for the Bossart-1X launcher. You'll need to attach the adapter tank on to the bottom before mounting the aft sections. The extremely thin walls of this tank are kept in tension by the pressure of the fuel (and pressurant gas as the fuel is used), providing a rigidity similar to a soda can. While extremely resilient, it cannot have other components radially attached to it, as doing so would compromise the structural integrity. //'
