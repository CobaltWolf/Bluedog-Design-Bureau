	description = This foil sheet is designed to capture solar wind particles. Once returned back to the lab, they can be analyzed to determine their composition and properties. Also useable as an emergency blanket if required. Must be brought in cargo storage and deployed on the surface by a kerbal. Run the experiment and collect the sample via the PAW post deployment. Does not require an Experiment Control Station.
