	description = Despite a... questionable track record during testing, this capsule is perhaps the pinnacle of our manned design program. While the Hermes and the Leo were essentially test vehicles, the Kane (pronounced 'khan-ay') is a real operational craft. Includes attitude control thrusters for reentry. Originally developed to be the orbiter segment of our Munar landing operations, a variety of upgrades and specialized components are being developed, and should become available in the near future.
