description = A recent procurement mistake has left us with too many RTG plutonium storage casks. In an effort to save funds, BDB's engineers have converted several to mystery goo observation systems. We were worried the residual radiation from the cask might damage the experiment, but the goo seems... happy.

real_description = A kerbalized version of the SNAP-27 RTG fuel cask. In real life, this stored the plutonium fuel pellet until it was removed and installed in the RTG. This version substitutes that for a mystery goo experiment.
