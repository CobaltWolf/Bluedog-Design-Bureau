	manufacturer = Bluedog Design Bureau
	description = As the lifetime of stations increased from months to years, it became impossible to rely solely on supplies brought up using the limited space inside Kane-11 capsules. The previous first generation ships that had supplied MOS stations could not bring the large volumes of supplies that were needed for sustained operations. This is the cargo volume for the Kanaloa Block I automated resupply ship, the standardized second generation cargo vessel. Note that it only serves as an ore carrier, unless fascinating ideas such as 'life support' or 'advanced science systems' have been discovered...
