	description = Similar to the Kane-11-MSM service module, the 13 variant includes a sufficient supply of fuel, monoprop, and large batteries storage for LKO missions. Complexity is reduced by simply packing batteries instead of fuel cells. Missions beyond LKO may void warranty. Engine, RCS quads, communication, lights and decoupler still not included. Allegations that a trash compactor is a key manufacturing component are entirely unfounded.

	real_description = Similar to the Block II service module, the Block III variant includes a sufficient supply of fuel, monoprop, and large batteries storage for LEO missions. Complexity is reduced by simply packing batteries instead of fuel cells. Missions beyond LEO may void warranty. Engine, RCS quads, communication, lights and decoupler still not included. Allegations that a trash compactor is a key manufacturing component are entirely unfounded.
