	description = While previous Kane-11 ships had relied on fuel cells or batteries to provide power, the longer duration missions demanded of the Block V meant that bringing enough consumables was impractical. These solar panels are fixed to the bottom of the engine mount, providing lightweight sustainable power for as long as needed.
