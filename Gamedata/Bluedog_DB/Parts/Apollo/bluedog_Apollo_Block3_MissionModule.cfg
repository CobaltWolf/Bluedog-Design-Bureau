While it was acceptable for short durations such as during takeoff and landing, any amount of time longer than an hour or so required a larger habitable volume. This mission module is essentially several more cubic meters of living space for the crew. Place it upside down in place of the lunar module, with docking ports on each end. Extract with the CSM after circularization.
