	description  = This tiny solid rocket motor is essentially the ancestor of a modern day Sepratron. They were originally used to push a Hermes away from its Muo booster. Another was placed on top of the HLR-P1 Ramo probe pointing upwards as a retro motor. We're sure you'll think of even more uses for it.
