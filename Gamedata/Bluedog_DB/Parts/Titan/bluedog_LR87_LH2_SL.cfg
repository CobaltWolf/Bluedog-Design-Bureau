	description = The Prometheus I's first stage engine was found to be resilient enough to be adapted not only to corrosive storable propellants, but also difficult to handle cryogenics. While not as efficient as some of the cryogenic engines that are in development, it can be used in either the upper or lower stage role. This version has a sea level optimized nozzle.

	real_description = The LR87 design was found to be reslient enough to be be adapted not only to corrosive storable propellants, but also difficult to handle cryogenics. The LR87 to this day remains the only engine to have been succesfully test fired with Kerolox, Hypergolic and Cryogenic fuels. The Cryogenic LR87 however was not selected for the Apollo program fro which it was intended. This version has a sea level optimized nozzle.
