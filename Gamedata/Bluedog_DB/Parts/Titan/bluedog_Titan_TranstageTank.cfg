	description = This short 1.875m fuel tank was designed for the "Metis" upper stage. It might not have the best fuel payload, but it does have some built in monopropellant. It's also fairly light for a tank of it's size. Be advised the tank defaults to only partially filling the monopropellant tanks - fill them up more if the tank is being used as a service module. Includes built in RCS blocks in aerodynamic shrouds.
