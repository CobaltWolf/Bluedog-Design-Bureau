	description = Radiation occurs in trace amounts all over Kerbin, but our scientists think that it is far more pervasive outside our atmosphere. This device measures the incoming ionizing radiation and gives us an idea of how irradiated space might be. Oh, sorry, we didn't mean to scare you. Don't worry. We're sure it's harmless.
