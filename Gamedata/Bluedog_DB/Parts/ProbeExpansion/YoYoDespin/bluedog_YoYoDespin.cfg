	description  = A small weight that when staged will move outwards on a rigid pole and then detach. Given angular momentum = mass * velocity * radius, increasing radius will decrease angular velocity since momentum is conserved. Technically this is not a yoyo despin device because there is no "snap" when the weight is fully extended stopping or reversing the spin. Always attach in symmetry. In typical use, a 0.3125 Spin Motor Decoupler is attached to the bottom of the kick motor (Staara 20), and the Despin Device is attached to the side of the kick motor or payload. First the spin motor "spins up" the vessel, then the kick motor is fired. When the kick motor completes its burn, the Despin Device is deployed to slow the spin rate back down.
