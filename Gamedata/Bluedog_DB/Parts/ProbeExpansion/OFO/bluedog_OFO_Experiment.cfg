	description = This small self contained laboratory can measure the adaptation of small, primitive organisms to a microgravity environment over an extended time. Originally used with a MIP probe core. Data gathered can be transmitted but the science returns will be lower than a dedicated recovorable experiment such as the Bion probe adapter.
