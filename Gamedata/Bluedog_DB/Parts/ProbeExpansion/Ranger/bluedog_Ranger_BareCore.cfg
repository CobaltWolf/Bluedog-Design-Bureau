	description = A bare version of the "Rorat" probe bus. The lack of thrusters means the internal monoprop storage could be deleted. The extra space was also used - finally - to add some batteries to the core... They're not very big, though.

	real_title = Mariner B Probe Bus
	real_manufacturer = Jet Propulsion Laboratory
	real_description = A double stacked version of the Ranger/Mariner bus for Mariner B. It includes expanded storage for monopropellant fuel, for use with the included attitude control thrusters or giving extra margin for course correction maneuvers. The extra space was also used - finally - to add some batteries to the core... They're not very big, though.
