	manufacturer = Bluedog Design Bureau
	description =  The rotating head with a mirror window allows the camera to take a mosaic of pictures of the landing site for analysis without having to move the actual camera. This is useful for evaluating the safety of a landing site ahead of sending a Kerbal crew, but there is only enough film for one site survey. If you need to run more surveys, bring additional cameras or have a Kerbonaut ironically replace the film.
