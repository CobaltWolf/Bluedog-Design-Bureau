	description  = Upon discovering that radio noise from Kerbin can interfere with radio astronomy observations, engineers set out to find a way to enable the REI satellite to preform its radio astronomy observations from Munar orbit. This small 0.3125m package contains two tiny monopropellant-fueled engines and four monopropellant tanks. This system can be used to help correct and refine the orbit of the REI spacecraft after Munar insertion. After this small stage has been used, it includes a built in decoupler to jettison it from the spacecraft. While it was originally designed for REI, it can be used for any number of applications.
