	description = Primitive, simple probe core with built in antennas. Useful as an early communications satellite, or perhaps a relay sat dropped from a larger probe bus. Their small size allows for an entire constellation to be deployed in a single launch and a dedicated multi decoupler system is available for this purpose.

	real_description = The Interim Defense Communication Satellite Program satellites were primitive, simple probe core with built in antennas that required no station keeping or active attitude control. Once the network was operational it was renamed Initial Defense Satellite Communication System. Their small size allows for an entire constellation to be deployed in a single launch and a dedicated multi decoupler system is available for this purpose.
