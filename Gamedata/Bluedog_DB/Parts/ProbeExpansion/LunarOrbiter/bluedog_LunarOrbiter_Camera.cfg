	description =  Film cameras are limited in that the film must be returned to Kerbin in order to be developed. In order to get a better idea of what lies further out in space, we have developed this advanced film camera in conjunction with our partner Codac. After exposing the film, it is developed automatically and then transmitted in strips using a primitive photoscanner. A significant amount of detail is lost in this process, so the images aren't as valuable as actually returning the film. The film is stored after development, and can be still be examined if it happens to be returned. //'
