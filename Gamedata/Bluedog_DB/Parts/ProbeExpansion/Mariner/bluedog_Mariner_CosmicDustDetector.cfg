	description = Our scientists think space might not be as empty as we once thought. Developed based on the experience learned from the Argo 2 cosmic dust experiment. This device contains plates for measuring the impacts of 'micrometeoroids', the little pieces of debris and particles that travel through open vacuum at thousands of meters per second. Measuring the number of impacts gives us an idea of how dangerous an area of space may be for our ships.
