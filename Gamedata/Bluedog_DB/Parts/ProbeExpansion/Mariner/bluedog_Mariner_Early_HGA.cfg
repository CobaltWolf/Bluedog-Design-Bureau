	description = Recent advancements in communications technology have allowed engineers to design this robust and effective uniquely shaped elliptical high-gain dish antenna intended for early Argo satellite planetary exploration missions. Its aluminum honeycomb structure allows for it to be lightweight, and the fact its fixed instead of tracking or deployable increases its relability and decreases its cost. The antenna was given an elliptical shape to make up for its inability to track and allows it to have a broader pointing range along the direction of Kerbin's orbital motion. Comes with multiple mounting configurations.
