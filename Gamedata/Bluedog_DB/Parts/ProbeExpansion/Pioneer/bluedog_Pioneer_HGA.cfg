	description  = A large high gain dish antenna (and medium gain antenna) designed for the Pilgrim-PNR10F spacecraft that is very light for its size. Great at transmitting at vast distances at the cost of transmission speed. Includes integrated RCS thrusters and two sun sensors that gives a small amount of SAS control. Equipped with several aft-mounted micrometeorite detection panels.
