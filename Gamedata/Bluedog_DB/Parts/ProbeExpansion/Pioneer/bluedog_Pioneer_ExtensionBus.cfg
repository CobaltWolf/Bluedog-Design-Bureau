	description = This compartment was designed with the purpose of being used as an extension to the Pilgrim-PNR10F "Allen" Probe Core. Designed as part of the PNR10X program, a series of proposals involving extending the lifespan of Pilgrim-PNR10 satellites and repurposing this hardware for new missions. It houses a small supply of monopropellant and an integrated battery. Can also be used as a platform for mounting equipment.
