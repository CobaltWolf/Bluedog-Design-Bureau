	description  = A pair of radioisotope electric generators intended for deep space missions, specifically designed for the Pilgrim-PNR10F spacecraft. The RTG is mounted on three extending rods so that the radiation being emitted from these generators does not damage or interfere with spacecraft electronics. This RTG can be upgraded by adding a third PB-PANS-19 unit to extend the operating life of the Pilgrim-PNR10 spacecraft as used in the Pilgrim-PNR10X mission proposals.
