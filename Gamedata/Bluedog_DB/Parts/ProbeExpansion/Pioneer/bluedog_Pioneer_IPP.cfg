	description = A small photopolarimeter imaging system intended for use with spin-stabilizers and designed for the Pilgrim-PNR10F spacecraft. Despite its crude and primitive spin-scan imagery it is highly robust and works in the harshest environments. Includes both a basic imaging experiment and a photopolarimeter experiment.
