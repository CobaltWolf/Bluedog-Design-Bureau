	description = A small photopolarimeter imaging system intended for use with spin-stabilized spacecraft and designed for the Pilgrim-PNR10F spacecraft. Unlike traditional TV camera imaging, this instrument does not have a vidicon tube, and instead uses spin-scan imaging techniques. It can also preform photopolarimetric observations in addition to imaging. Despite its crude and primitive imagery it is highly robust and works in the harshest environments. Includes both a basic imaging experiment and a photopolarimeter experiment.
