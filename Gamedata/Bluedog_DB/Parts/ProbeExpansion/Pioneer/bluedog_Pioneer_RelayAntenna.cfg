	description  = Engineers at Bluedog Design Bureau took the Pilgrim-PNR10F-SBLGA Low Gain Omni Antenna, added a ground plate and other equipment to upgrade its capabilities so it can serve as a short-range relay antenna. Designed for missions involving the Pilgrim-PNR10X-APP "Caelus" Atmospheric Entry Probe, this antenna can achieve a link with the atmospheric entry probe so the Pilgrim-PNR10X spacecraft can relay it back to Kerbin.
