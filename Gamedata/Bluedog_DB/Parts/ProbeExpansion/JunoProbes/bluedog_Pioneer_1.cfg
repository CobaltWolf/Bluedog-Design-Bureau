	description = This 0.3125m probe core integrates an omni antenna and geiger counter for measuring radation. Designed to be flung hopefully at the Mun, it has an integrated retro motor to help capture it into orbit. Without any onboard power generation it is strongly suggested to hibernate the probe between maneuvers to reduce power consumption. It features BDB's SafeSolid™ system, allowing the engine to be shut down in flight, allowing for more accurate orbital insertions and manuevers.
