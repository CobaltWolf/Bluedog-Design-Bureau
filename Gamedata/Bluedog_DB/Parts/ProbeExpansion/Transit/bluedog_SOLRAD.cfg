	description = A tiny satellite that evolved from the Easton-V3 probe core. Small and unassuming, the SR-1 is presented to the public as a scientific satellite to study solar x-rays. However this is a cover for its classified primary mission, to intercept signals from the Krussians. It is designed to be launched as a secondary (or tertiary) payload, but it can also be launched by itself. Includes a built in decoupler as well as antennas.
