	description = A tiny, versatile satellite bus designed to be as compact and light as possible. While one of the smallest of the program, this satellite bus is the most advanced of the TNSS program. While designed for navigation constellations, this satellite bus can be used for a number of things. Includes all the basic necessities that a probe core would have, although to keep it as light as possible it has only minimal SAS control.
