	description = An extended version of the SR-1 "Jekyll" probe core. The P-20 "Tulip-1" pushes this design to its maximum intelligence collection capabilities. Unlike its previous incarnations, the fact this satellite is a SIGINT/ELINT reconnaissance satellite is no longer secret. It is designed to be launched as a secondary (or tertiary) payload, but it can also be launched by itself. Includes a built in decoupler as well as antennas.
