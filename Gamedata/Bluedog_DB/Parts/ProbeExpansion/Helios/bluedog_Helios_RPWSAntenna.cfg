	description = RPWS whip antenna for the Sonne spacecraft, created as a joint project between BDB and our teutonic partners. Place one on each side of the HEOS probe core on the mounting plates provided. Do note that while it technically works with only one antenna, using at least two would theoretically provide much better data.
