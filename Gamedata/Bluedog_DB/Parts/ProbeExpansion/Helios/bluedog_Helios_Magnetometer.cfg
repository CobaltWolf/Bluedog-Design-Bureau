	description = Large magnetometer on an extending arm for the Sonne spacecraft, created as a joint project between BDB and our teutonic partners. Place one on each side of the HEOS probe core on the mounting plates provided. Includes two different variants of magnetometer. We can't figure out if anything is different between them, but it sure does look cool to have two different kinds.
