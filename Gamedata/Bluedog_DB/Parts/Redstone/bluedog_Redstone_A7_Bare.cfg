Initially used on the Sandstone ballistic missile, the engine would later be upgraded to use a more volatine Hydyne fuel. The engine was also used on the Hermes Sandstone launch vehicle but the designers went back to the safer although less performant Alcolox mix. This bare version has no gimbal ability.
