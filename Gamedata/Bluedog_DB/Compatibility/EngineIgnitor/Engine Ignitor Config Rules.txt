Booster engines get 1 ignition

AJ10 derivatives get 50 ignitions usually, check the RO wiki otherwise

Have ullage disabled for all engines until further updates from LGG, functionality is currently very broken and unpredictable.

All engines get a 0.2 chance to ignite when unstable, this is currently meaningless with ullage disabled and is a placeholder until ullage becomes safe to add again
