Ignition data from Realism Overhaul or best guess.

AJ10 derivatives get 50 ignitions usually, check the RO wiki otherwise

Most sea level engines have external ignitions. A launch clamp is needed within range of the engine to ignite. BDB's own launch clamps have been patched to support this and have a range of 30 meters.

At time of writing Modular Launch Pads is not supported but a PR has been made to add external ignitor capabilities to MLP and will likely be supported in next EI release. [19 oct 2019]

Air startable sea level engines have a single internal ignition such as Titan LR87s. It does mean they can be restarted if initially ground started using launch clamps. Don't do it though!
