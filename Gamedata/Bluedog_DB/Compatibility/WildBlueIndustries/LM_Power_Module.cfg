			// In Breaking Ground Science, Power Unit is an integer, but resources like ElectricCharge use decimals.
			// The default is 0.25, so 1.0 EC = 4 PU.
			// This number was derived by comparing the size of the Breaking Ground Mini-NUK-PB RTG to the stock PB-NUK RTG,
			// and looking how how much ElectricCharge the stock RTG produces. That actually gives us 0.375 (the Mini-NUK is
			// about half as tall as the stock RTG), but we dropped that to 0.25 to make the math easier.
			ecPerPowerUnit = 0.25

			// The maximum number of Power Units that the converter can provide.
			// Note that this is an integer value. The default is 10.
			// Multiply by ecPerPowerUnit to calculate how much ElectricCharge/sec that the power converter will consume.
			// If you leave focus on the vessel and come back, then the E.C. will be drained accordingly.
