//Commnet constellation does not recognize probe cores with a built in relay as their antenna (IDCSP etc)
//Adding a second direct antenna module makes the probe work as a relay but it will treat it as a single antenna and will take the power of whichever is lower.
//Until this gets fixed on CNC's end this patch adds a second direct antenna module to the relavant probe cores with antenna power equal to the original relay module.
