-Added parts based on the real life Mercury Spacecraft, donated from PassingLurker's Bloeting mod!
-Added Karrot 2 man pod.
-Atlas V parts were redone entirely. The textures are currently low-res, and will be updated at some point in the future.
-Most of the textures for the launcher parts were redone, to add more detail.
-Real plumes support added, courtesy of VenomousRequiem.
-Added Bluedog Design Bureau as a working agency. I didn't break the game this time, I promise. I think.
-Bloeting Corp is also an agency.

0.07 (Rockets expansion!)
-Added Vanguard 0.975m lifter parts
-Added Able 0.625m upper stage parts
-Added Ablestar 0.9375m upper stage parts
-Added long 1.25m fuel tank for Redstone
-Added 0.5m radial SRB
-Added parts for Thor 1.5m launcher
-Fixed exhaust on the Atlas verniers
-Added custom fairing textures to some of the BDB fairing bases. They no longer use the stock texture.
-Tweaked the Atlas engine textures. They needed some work.
-Fixed the Atlas engine fairings.

0.06 (Atlas!) (5/11/2015)
-Added Atlas launch system!
-Added Centaur upper stage!

0.05b
-Fixed science compatibility - your modded career should work again!
-Redid B109-D model
-Moved B109-D to General Rocketry

0.05 (IMPACT!) (10/21/2015)
-Micrometeoroid Detector now animates! REAL (fake) IMPACTS!
-Micrometeoroid Impacts are now powered by DMagicScienceAnimateGeneric (that's a mouthful) - if you like them give him thanks!
-Made changes to the model of the Micrometeoroid Detector
-Added some sciencedefs for each stock body to the Micrometeoroid Detector. 
-Added several new sciencedefs to the Ion Trap.
-Updated science parts and merged them onto a smaller texture sheet.
-Edited the collider for the Ion Trap. Should be easier to right click now.
-Added Mass Spectrometer experiment. Find out what's in that cosmic dust!
-Added Geiger Counter experiment. Find out how irradiated your kerbals are getting!
-All antennas had their mesh and textures updated.
-Added MSC Dome Antenna - Looks like a backwards dish antenna and functions about as well. 60Mm range, 40 degree arc.
-Added DP-75 Dipole Antenna - The antenna for people that thought Darth Maul's lightsaber was the coolest. 5Mm range.
-Minor buff to the M17 antenna's charge rate - should make it slightly more useful.
-N100 Omni now uses geiger counter and mag scan science defs from FASA and DMagic respectively.
-Removed N120... sorry.
-Redid Sienno probe parts. They now take up less texture memory and are more adaptable.
-Added adapter to Sienno probe core. Use the bottom node for a built in .3125m adapter plate.
-Added small decoupler for sienno parts, goes from .625m > .3125m.
-Added thermometer experiment to Sienno probe core.
-Added BDB as a contractor. I haven't been able to test it much. Let me know if it works.

0.04 (Atlas V) (9/10/2015)
-Finished texture updates that were unlisted in 0.03. Antennas should look a bit better now.
-Added Muo-2207 Liquid Engine - 2.5m engine based on the RD-180. For now it's a slightly more powerful Mainsail.
-Added Muo-2585 Fuel Tank - 2.5m fuel tank based on lower half of Atlas V CCB tank. Inbetween Jumbo-64 and X200-32.
-Added Tweakscale support to engines, Muo tank, PGM CS.
-Added BDB flag. It's a wurf.
-Fixed a few small cfg errors.

0.03 (Redstone) (7/10/2015)
-Resized Sienno parts to .125m in anticipation of the Taerobee WAC
-Added PGM Liquid Fuel Engine - 1.25m, early rocket. Less powerful than LVTs but cheaper + more efficient.
-Added PGM Control Surface - Winglet + Control surface for PGM Engine. Includes thrust vanes. Because I like ya a lot.
-Added B109-D Radial Engine - Basically a half sized Mk55, unlocks slightly earlier. Helps add control authority and TWR to rockets. 
-Made it so Sienno probe core actually works with Remotetech.

0.02 (Antennas!) (6/10/2015)
-Added 'A' to the beginning of each antenna's name, to help with VAB organization.
-Added AN120 Omni Antenna - side folding version of the N100
-Added AKD2 Antenna - Extremely simple starting antenna. Short range, weighs almost nothing, has almost no power draw. 1Mm range.
-Added AA23 Antenna - Mid tech omni antenna. Nothing special, mostly looks cool/different. 2.5Mm range.
-Added AF23 Helical Antenna - Early tech communications antenna. Short but wide.
-Added AWPT Scimitar Antenna - Mid tech 'dish' antenna. 35Mm range, 120 degree arc.
-Added Remotetech definitions for original antennas:
	-AN100 omni now has a 10Mm range. That size has to be good for something, nyeh?
	-AA27-C omni now has a 7Mm range. Again, it's heavy.
	-AM17 omni now has 2Mm range. Might buff to 2.5Mm same as communotron 16.
-Added functioning experiments to Sienno probe and N100 omni antenna.

0.01 (Alpha release 30/9/2015)
